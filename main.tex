\begin{abstract}
The behaviour of n-alkanes confined and sheared between iron oxide surfaces has been investigated using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The chain extension and orientation, film structure and flow, and friction have been measured for a range of chain lengths under conditions representative of the elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime. At high pressure, the molecules show strong layering and long-range order, suggesting solid-like films. Conversely, high shear rates result in less elongated, layered, and ordered chains; indicating more liquid-like films. Although Couette flow is usually observed for short chains, the flow is often non-linear for long chains. The friction coefficient increases logarithmically with shear rate, but the slope decreases with increasing pressure such that it becomes insensitive to shear rate for long chains.

\section{Introduction}

A detailed understanding of the molecular-scale behaviour of fluids confined, pressurised, and sheared between solid surfaces critical in tribology. In particular, for lubricated machine components that are based on elements that roll and slide together (e.g. rolling bearings, gears, constant velocity joints and cam/follower systems), a significant portion of the friction losses originate from the elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime. In the EHL regime, thin lubricant films (nm) are subjected to very high pressures (GPa) and shear rates ($> 10^{7}~\SI{}{\per\second}$). These conditions are extremely challenging to probe directly through experiment, and thus the behaviour of lubricants under EHL conditions remains somewhat unclear~\cite{Spikes2014}.

\textcolor{blue}{Alongside experiments, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations can provide unique insights into the behaviour of lubricants under EHL conditions~\cite{Ewen2018}. Since the early 1990s, many studies have investigated the behaviour of lubricants strongly confined ($< 6$ molecular layers) between solid surfaces, where confinement is known to significantly increase the viscosity~\cite{Granick1991}. Early NEMD simulations of thin atomic and molecular fluid films suggested that this viscosity increase was due to vitrification to a glassy state or even crystallization for atomic fluids~\cite{Thompson1992}. Indeed, MD simulations of $n$-dodecane (C$_{12}$) showed a trasition from liquidlike to solidlike behaviour between 6 and 7 molecular layers at ambient temperature and pressure~\cite{Cui2001}. Further MD simulations of C$_{12}$ suggested that the initial increase in viscosity from confinement is due to the formation of crystal bridges between the surfaces, which is followed by a further increase due to tetratic order upon increasing confinement~\cite{Jabbarzadeh2006,Jabbarzadeh2007}.

NEMD simulations of strongly confined systems showed flow behaviour that deviated from the linear (Couette) case, such as slip at the solid walls, as well as slip between molecular layers within the fluid film itself~\cite{Thompson1990}. NEMD comparisons between thin (8 molecular layers) films of different $n$-alkane chain lengths (C$_6$-C$_{80}$) suggested that, at low pressure (\SI{0.1}{\mega\pascal}), interlayer slip within the ordered film occurred and shear stress was sensitive to the chain length~\cite{Koike1998}. Conversely, at high pressure (\SI{100}{\mega\pascal}), boundary slip occurred and the shear stress was insensitive to the chain length~\cite{Koike1998}. For thin $n$-alkane films at high pressure (\SI{500}{\mega\pascal}) between $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ surfaces, where no slip occurred, the shear stress was shown to be dependent on chain length (C$_{1}$-C$_{25}$)~\cite{Savio2013a}. The shear stress was also dependant on chain length (C$_{20}$-C$_{1400}$) for thin (7 molecular layers) $n$-alkane films sheared between polymer-like surfaces at low pressure (\SI{10}{\mega\pascal}), where no slip occurred~\cite{Sivebaek2008}. However, for metal-like surfaces, on which the $n$-alkanes showed slip, the shear stress was independent on the chain length under the same conditions~\cite{Sivebaek2008}. For the same systems, the shear stress was also shown to increase monotonically with the sliding velocity for metal-like surfaces but to be independent of sliding velocity on polymer-like surfaces~\cite{Sivebaek2010}. It was also found that shorter (C$_{20}$) chains melted at shear rates, whereas longer chains only showed thermal softening~\cite{Sivebaek2012}. NEMD simulations of very thick ($>$ 400 nm) C$_{6}$ films confined between Fe surfaces under EHL conditions confirmed the applicability of no-slip boundary conditions in this case~\cite{Washizu2010,Washizu2014}.}

Relatively fewer NEMD studies have investigated the behaviour of thicker lubricant films ($\geq 10$ molecular layers) of direct relevance to EHL. Both NEMD simulations~\cite{Thompson1992,Robbins1996} and experiments~\cite{VanAlsten1988} have suggested that there could be similarities between the behaviour of strongly confined films and thicker films subjected to high pressures. Indeed, comprehensive NEMD simulations of relatively thick (35 atomic layers) atomic fluid films showed a range of `nonequilibrium phases' under high shear rate and pressure conditions.~\cite{Heyes2012,Gattinoni2013} This behaviour was reminiscent of previous observations for more strongly confined films at lower pressure~\cite{Thompson1990}. Further NEMD simulations showed that the nonequilibrium phase transitions observed at high pressure can lead to deviations from classical friction laws~\cite{Mackowiak2016}, which has also been observed for thinner $n$-alkane films at lower pressure~\cite{Sivebaek2010}. Recently, unusual friction and nonequilibrium phase behaviour has also been observed in NEMD simulations of relatively thick films of model lubricant and traction fluid molecules under EHL conditions~\cite{Ewen2017a}. To design new lubricant molecules to control EHL friction, a clear understanding of how molecular structure affects friction and nonequilibrium phase behaviour is required.

In the present study, the behaviour of $n$-alkanes confined, pressurised, and sheared between $\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3$ surfaces (as a model for steel) has been investigated under EHL conditions using NEMD simulations. The effect of $n$-alkane chain length (C$_{16}$-C$_{60}$), applied pressure ($0.5 - 1.5~\SI{}{\giga\pascal}$) and shear rate ($10^{9} - 10^{10} ~\SI{}{\per\second}$) on the chain extension and orientation, film structure and flow, and friction has been studied simultaneously. These results shed further light on the molecular-scale behaviour of model lubricants under EHL conditions.

\section{Methodology}
\label{method}

Classical MD simulations were performed using the large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS) software~\cite{Plimpton1995}. The velocity-Verlet algorithm was used to integrate the equations of motion with a time-step of \SI{1.0}{\femto\second}. All of the initial configurations were generated using the open source LAMMPS\_builder software~\cite{Ewen2017b,Ewen2017}, which utilises Moltemplate~\cite{Jewett2013} and the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)~\cite{HjorthLarsen2017}. The systems consist of two parallel atomically-smooth surfaces separated an approximately \SI{8}{\nano\meter} thick $n$-alkane lubricant layer, see Figure \ref{fig:Regions}. The $n$-alkane layer was sufficiently thick ($\geq 16$ molecular layers) such that the lubricant was not strongly layered in the middle of the film and thus any confinement-induced viscosity increase was expected to be negligible~\cite{Gee1990}. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in the \emph{x} and \emph{y} directions.

The lubricant layer consisted of $n$-alkanes of different lengths: $n$-hexadecane (C$_{16}$), $n$-triacontane (C$_{30}$) and $n$-hexacontane (C$_{60}$). For all the cases, a  total number of 19200 carbon atoms were inserted into the system; this corresponds to 1200, 640 and 320 molecules for C$_{16}$, C$_{30}$ and C$_{60}$, respectively. In modern engine oils, most lubricant molecules are in the middle of this range, with $n$-alkanes constituting a significant proportion of the various isomers present~\cite{Liang2018}.

Parameters from the long hydrocarbon-optimised potentials for liquid simulations, all-atom force field (L-OPLS-AA)~\cite{Jorgensen1996,Siu2012} were used for the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the alkane chains. This force-field has been shown to correctly describe the viscous behaviour of long alkanes under ambient and high temperature, high pressure conditions~\cite{Ewen2016a}. Moreover, all-atom force-fields have also been shown to be important to accurately model phase transitions in confined alkane systems~\cite{Docherty2010}. Cross-interactions were evaluated using the geometric mean mixing rules~\cite{Jorgensen1996}. All C-H bonds were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm~\cite{Ryckaert1977}. Lennard-Jones interactions were cut off at \SI{12}{\angstrom} and electrostatic interactions were evaluated using a slab implementation of the particle-particle-particle-mesh (PPPM) algorithm~\cite{Yeh1999} with a relative accuracy in the forces of \SI{1e-7}{}.

Hematite $\left(\text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3\right)$ slabs were chosen as a representative model for steel surfaces~\cite{Oh1998}. The hematite  slabs~\cite{Maslen1994} were cleaved and oriented such that the $\left[100\right]$ plane is in contact with the lubricant (see Figure \ref{fig:Regions}). The thickness of the surfaces in the \emph{z} direction is \SI{13.7}{\angstrom} and the size of the surface in the \emph{x} and \emph{y} directions are \SI{80.5}{\angstrom} and \SI{78.4}{\angstrom} respectively. The cell dimensions were large enough to prevent the interaction of individual $n$-alkane chains with their own periodic image under shear. The Fe and O surface atoms are restrained in the corundum crystal structure~\cite{Maslen1994} with harmonic bonds between atoms within \SI{3}{\angstrom}. The force constant of these bonds was  \SI{130}{\kilo\calorie\per\mol\per\angstrom\squared}, which has been shown previously to be a reasonable compromise between surface rigidity and thermostatting efficiency~\cite{Berro2010}. The surface Fe and O Lennard-Jones and partial charge parameters, which determine the strength of the interactions with the lubricant atoms were taken from  ref.~\cite{Savio2012} and ref.~\cite{Berro2010} respectively. These parameters were developed to reproduce experimental desorption energies of $n$-alkanes on hematite surfaces.~\cite{Savio2012}

\subsection{Equilibration}

First, $n$-alkane molecules were inserted between the slabs in an ordered fashion, followed by energy minimisation. Next, a properly equilibrated system was a generated using a simple heat-quench sequence. In this procedure, the initially ordered $n$-alkanes were heated to \SI{2000}{\kelvin} to accelerate diffusion, and left to evolve until equilibrium is reached (\SI{10}{\nano\second}). The system was then quenched back to the target temperature \SI{353}{\kelvin} over a further \SI{10}{\nano\second}. During the heat-quench sequence, the fluid temperature was controlled using a global Langevin thermostat~\cite{Schneider1978}, with a damping constant of \SI{0.1}{\pico\second}, acting in all Cartesian directions.

Three different criteria were considered to ensure that the systems had reached equilibrium. Specifically, verifying that the mean square end-to-end distance, $\left(\left< R^2 \right> \right)$ and the mean square radius of gyration $\left(\left< S^2 \right> \right)$ reached a steady state~\cite{Brown1994}. The final criterion reflects the fact that systems of long chain alkanes which are not properly equilibrated can present deformation on short  length scales, and this deformation is only relaxed after the chains have moved a distance equivalent to their own size~\cite{Auhl2003}. In order to verify this, the mean-squared displacement for the C atoms $\left(\text{MSD}_{\text{atom}}\right)$ and for the centre of mass of the alkane chains $\left(\text{MSD}_{\text{CG}}\right)$ were also monitored during equilibration. More details regarding the equilibration procedure can be found in the Appendix. The final equilibrated configurations were used as inputs for the following compression and shear simulations. 

\subsection{Compression}

After the systems were properly equilibrated, the pressure was increased by assigning a constant normal (\emph{z}) force to the outer layer of Fe atoms in the top wall while keeping the outer layer of atoms in the bottom wall fixed in the \emph{z} direction (see Figure \ref{fig:Regions}). Three different pressure values were considered; \SI{0.5}{\giga\pascal}, \SI{1.0}{\giga\pascal}, and \SI{1.5}{\giga\pascal}. These pressures are of direct relevance to lubricants in the the EHL regime~\cite{Spikes2014}.

	\end{center}
\end{figure}

For the compression and shear stages, the temperature of the system is controlled (T = \SI{353}{\kelvin}) by a Langevin thermostat~\cite{Schneider1978} with a damping coefficient of \SI{0.1}{\pico\second}, acting on the middle layer of atoms in both slabs (\textit{thermostat} in Figure \ref{fig:Regions}). The thermostat was applied only in the direction perpendicular to both the sliding and compression (\emph{y}). This approach has been shown to be more physically accurate compared to application of the thermostat directly to the confined fluid, which can significantly affect friction and flow behaviour, particularly at high shear rates~\cite{Liem1992,Bernardi2010,Yong2013}.

The compression phase is performed in two steps; first, the pressure is linearly incremented over \SI{10}{\nano\second} and then the target pressure is maintained for a further \SI{10}{\nano\second}. The density of the fluid region and the average pressure both reach a steady state well within the simulation time. The average $n$-alkane densities over the final \SI{1}{\nano\second} of the compression phase are presented in Table \ref{tab:rho}. In agreement with experiments data~\cite{Griesbaum2000}, there is an increase in average density with increasing $n$-alkane chain length, as well as with increasing pressure.

\subsection{Shear}

After the $n$-alkanes are equilibrated at the target pressures (\SI{0.5}-\SI{1.5}{\giga\pascal}), the shear response of the lubricant was studied. A shear velocity gradient was imposed on the system by applying an equal and opposite sliding velocity, $v_x = \pm v_s/2$, to the outermost layer of atoms in each slab (see Figure \ref{fig:Regions}) in the \emph{x} direction. The following sliding velocities were considered, $v_s$; \SI{10}{\meter\per\second}, \SI{20}{\meter\per\second}, \SI{50}{\meter\per\second} and \SI{100}{\meter\per\second}. For the simulated film thickness (approx. \SI{8}{\nano\meter}), these correspond to applied shear rates, $\dot{\gamma}$, of approximately 10$^{9}$-10$^{10} \text{s}^{-1}$. While these are above those encountered in real engineering components (10$^{6}$-10$^{8} \text{s}^{-1}$)~\cite{Taylor2017}, lower shear rates do not reach a steady state in the available simulation time for the long chains studied~\cite{Ewen2018}.

To verify that a nonequilibrium steady state was reached, the evolution of $\left< R^2 \right>$, $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right>$~\cite{Erman1985} and $F_L$ on the surfaces in response to the fluid, were monitored. Lower sliding velocities require a longer simulation time to reach a steady state (up to 200 ns); however, they require a similar sliding distance, in agreement with experimental observations~\cite{Drummond2000}. In general, a steady state is reached in a shorter sliding distance for shorter $n$-alkanes and lower pressures. A representative case is C$_{30}$ at \SI{1.0}{\giga\pascal}, for which the evolution of $\left< R^2 \right>$, $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right>$, and $F_L$ are presented at four sliding velocities in Figure \ref{fig:SS}.

Since the initial configuration is the same for all of the sliding velocities, they all have an initial value of $\left< R^2 \right> = \SI{283}{\angstrom\squared}$. After this point, $\left< R^2 \right> $ increases and then asymptotes towards a steady state value. This suggests that the chains generally unfold when shear is applied. The steady state $\left< R^2 \right>$ generally decreases with increasing sliding velocity. This is consistent with previous confined NEMD simulations of long $n$-alkanes at high shear rates~\cite{Cho2017}.

For ideal chains in the bulk, the average segmental orientation, $\langle P_{2}^{xz}\rangle=0.25$. This suggests a uniform distribution of the orientation of the chains, which corresponds to an average orientation angle of \SI{45}{\degree}. When under confinement, $n$-alkane molecules close to the surfaces tend to align parallel to them~\cite{Cho2017}, meaning that the angle between the chain and the surface is close to zero, and hence $\langle P_{2}^{xz}\rangle$ increases. In the case of C$_{30}$ at \SI{1.0}{\giga\pascal}, $\langle P_{2}^{xz}\rangle=0.32$ before shear is applied (see Figure \ref{fig:SS}b), indicating that there is already a preferential orientation due to the presence of the surfaces. When sliding is initiated, the chains begin to align with the flow direction, further increasing $\langle P_{2}^{xz}\rangle$. Generally, $\langle P_{2}^{xz}\rangle$ decreases with increasing sliding velocity, this is discussed in the next section.

The shear stress was monitored through the average lateral (friction) force $F_L$ (or shear stress) acting on the outermost layer of atoms (frozen atoms in Figure \ref{fig:Regions}) in the top and bottom slabs (divided by the surface area) in response to the fluid. At the onset of sliding, $F_L$ increases rapidly to reach a maximum value and then decreases before reaching a steady state, indicating `stress overshoot' behaviour~\cite{Jeong2017}. The sliding distance needed for $F_L$ to reach a steady state is consistent with that needed for $\left< R^2 \right> $ and $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right> $ (Figure \ref{fig:SS}). Thus $F_L$ reaches a minimum only when the $n$-alkane chains extend and align with the flow. Generally, $F_L$ increases with increasing sliding velocity, this is discussed in the next section.

Once the simulations reach a steady state (Figure \ref{fig:SS}), they are run for a further \SI{5}{\nano\second} to \SI{20}{\nano\second} while maintaining a constant sliding velocity and applied pressure. During the final \SI{2}{\nano\second} of the simulation, $\left< R^2 \right>$, $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right> $, and $F_L$ are measured and averaged. These results are presented and discussed in the next section.

\section{Results and Discussion}

First, the effect of chain length, pressure, and shear rate on the chain extension, $\left< R^2 \right>$ and orientation, $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right> $ are studied in Section \ref{ext}. The change in film structure and flow are investigated through mass density and velocity profiles as well as radial distribution functions in Section \ref{str}. Finally, the dependency of the friction on the chain length, pressure, and shear rate are presented in Section \ref{fri}.

\subsection{Chain extension and orientation}
\label{ext}

Longer chains will inherently have higher absolute values of $\left< R^2 \right> $, so to compare the variation of $\left< R^2 \right> $ between the different chain lengths, the mean square end-to-end distance was normalised \emph{per C-C bond}; $\left< R^2 \right>/\left(N_\text{bonds}\right)^2$. The steady state $\left< R^2 \right> $ per C-C bond is presented as a function of shear rate for the different chain lengths and pressures studied in Figure \ref{fig:e2e2_v}.

Figure \ref{fig:e2e2_v} shows that $\left< R^2 \right>/\left(N_\text{bonds}\right)^2$ generally decreases with increasing shear rate, suggesting less extended chain conformations. This has also been observed in previous bulk~\cite{Cui1996} and confined~\cite{Sivebaek2008,Cho2017} NEMD simulations of similar $n$-alkanes at high shear rates. This decrease has been attributed to strong intermolecular collisions which lead to intense chain rotation and tumbling dynamics at higher shear rates~\cite{Cho2017}. Longer chains are relatively less extended than shorter chains at all pressures and shear rates studied, as expected for $n$-alkanes in the absence of confinement and shear. Pressure has a negligible effect on $\left< R^2 \right>/\left(N_\text{bonds}\right)^2$ for the systems and condiions studied here.

More surprisingly, Figure \ref{fig:P2_v} shows that there is also a general decrease of $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right> $ with increasing shear rate. This indicates an increase of the average angle of segments relative to the shearing direction at higher shear rate (see Appendix), meaning that the chains are less aligned with flow direction. Although such behaviour has also been observed in bulk NEMD simulations of $n$-alkanes at high shear rates~\cite{Padilla1992}, the opposite trend is more commonly reported~\cite{Cho2017,Cui1996}. This discrepancy can be rationalised through the high pressures applied in these simulations which lead to the fluids becoming solid-like, which is discussed further in the following section. Previous experiments~\cite{Drummond2002} and NEMD simulations~\cite{Cho2017} have shown that $n$-alkanes close to the confining walls align with the shear direction. Under the high pressures applied in these NEMD simulations, the ordered region extends further towards the centre of the film (Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}), leading to a high value of $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right> $. As the shear rate is increased, the film becomes more liquid-like (Figure \ref{fig:RDF}), and the thickness of the ordered region decreases (Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}), and thus $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right> $ also decreases. Consistent with previous bulk NEMD simulations~\cite{Cui1996}, longer chains tend be more aligned with the shearing direction, while the chains are slightly less aligned at higher pressure.

\subsection{Film structure and flow}
\label{str}

The radial distribution function (RDF), $g(r)$ for the C atoms was calculated using a cut-off distance of \SI{20}{\angstrom} (see Figure \ref{fig:RDF}). Note that C atoms separated from each other by one or two C-C bonds were excluded from the calculations.

Peak splitting in the RDFs is observed for all of the systems and conditions studied, which shows different ranges of order and is indicative of glassy behaviour~\cite{Bulacu2007,Valencia-Jaime2019}. 
%
Three intramolecular RDF peaks are observed at C-C separations of: $d_1 \approx \SI{3.2}{\angstrom}$, $d_2 \approx \SI{3.9}{\angstrom}$ and $d_3 \approx \SI{5.1}{\angstrom}$ (see \ref{fig:RDF_Peaks}). The $d_1$ and $d_2$ peaks can be mostly attributed to C atoms separated by three bonds in $gauche$ and $trans$ conformations respectively~\cite{Bulacu2007}. The latter peak is much more intense, indicating that most of the chains are in extended conformations. The $d_3$ peak is mostly due to C atoms separated by four bonds, and its high intensity further suggests that the chains are in mostly extended conformations. These observations are consistent with the trends shown previously for $\left< R^2 \right>/\left(N_\text{bonds}\right)^2$ (Figure \ref{fig:e2e2_v}).

There are additional peaks at larger distances in Figure \ref{fig:RDF}, which are indicative of long-range order and thus solid-like films~\cite{Tsuchiya2001,Kalyanasundaram2009}. These peaks are more intense at higher pressure and lower sliding velocity; suggesting more solid-like films under these conditions. Moreover, comparing the size of the $d_1$ and $d_2$ peaks in Figure \ref{fig:RDF}, it is clear that there is a smaller trans/gauche ratio at high pressure and lower speed, a further indication of more solid-like films under these conditions~\cite{Kavitha2007}. The relative peak intensities also suggest that longer chains are more solid-like compared to shorter chains, which is expected from their higher melting points (C$_{16}$ = 291 K, C$_{30}$ = 339 K, C$_{60}$ = 373 K).

Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2} shows the atomic mass density profile in the \emph{z}-dimension and \emph{x}-velocity profile in the \emph{z}-dimension profiles for the shortest and longest chains (C$_{16}$-C$_{60}$) and lowest and highest pressures (0.5-\SI{1.5}{\giga\pascal}) and sliding velocities (10-\SI{100}{\meter\per\second}) studied.

The mass density profiles in Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2} show the through-thickness layering of the fluids, which is strongest close to the walls. Generally, longer chains (C$_{60}$ in blue) show stronger layering compared to shorter chains (C$_{16}$ in purple), suggesting they form more solid-like films~\cite{Ewen2017a}. Comparing Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}a with \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}b and Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}c with \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}d shows that the films become less layered (particularly in the centre of the film), and thus more liquid-like at higher sliding velocity. Comparing Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}a with \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}c and Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}b with \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}d shows that the films become more layered and thus more solid-like at higher pressure.

At the onset of shear, the velocity profiles show deviations from planar Couette flow for several of the systems and conditions studied; however, in most cases, a Couette profile develops once a nonequilibrium steady state is reached (see example in Appendix). Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2} shows steady state velocity profiles for the lowest and highest chain length, pressure, and sliding velocity investigated. At low sliding velocity and low pressure (Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}a), the flow for C$_{16}$ (purple) remains Couette-like, whereas C$_{60}$ (blue) shows some central localisation (CL). CL describes the outer solid-like regions of the fluid moving at the same velocity as the neighbouring walls, with only the centre of the film being sheared~\cite{Heyes2012}. The transition from Couette flow to CL has been observed for viscous polymers using in-contact photoluminescence experiments under EHL conditions~\cite{Galmiche2016}. It has also been observed in previous NEMD simulations of atomic fluids~\cite{Heyes2012,Gattinoni2013,Mackowiak2016} as well as alkanes and traction fluids~\cite{Ewen2017a} under EHL conditions. At high sliding velocity and low pressure (Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}b), Couette flow is maintained for C$_{16}$ and while C$_{60}$ shows a linear velocity profile, there is a small amount of boundary slip at the fluid-wall interface (slip length $\leq$ 1 nm). Boundary slip has also been observed in previous NEMD simulations of thin fluid films~\cite{Jabbarzadeh1999,Sivebaek2010,Ta2017,Porras-Vazquez2018}. However, NEMD simulations of thicker films more commonly show no-slip boundary conditions~\cite{Washizu2010,Washizu2014}. At low sliding velocity and high pressure, (Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}c), C$_{16}$ shows Couette flow while C$_{60}$ shows CL. Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}d shows that C$_{16}$ also slips at high pressure ($\approx$ 10 nm). Moreover, the slip length increases ($\approx$ 40 nm) with increasing pressure for C$_{60}$, which is consistent with previous NEMD simulations~\cite{Ta2017} and in-contact photoluminescence experiments~\cite{Ponjavic2014} of different fluids.

\subsection{Friction}
\label{fri}

\textcolor{blue}{Figure \ref{fig:FL_FN} shows that shear stress increases with increasing pressure. This is in agreement with the Amontons-Coulomb friction law under the high load approximation; $F_L/F_N = F_0/F_N + \mu$, where $F_L$ and $F_N$ are respectively the mean lateral force and normal force acting on the outer layer of atoms in each slab in response to the fluid, $\mu$ is the friction coefficient, and $F_0$ is the load-independent Derjaguin offset, which represents adhesive surface forces~\cite{Eder2013,Ewen2017}. The $\mu$ and $F_0$ were respectively calculated from the gradient and intercept of the linear fits in Figure \ref{fig:FL_FN} for the different systems and conditions studied. Friction anisotropy has been observed in previous experiments~\cite{Kristiansen2012} and NEMD simulations~\cite{Jabbarzadeh2016} of strongly-confined $n$-alkanes, but was not observed for the relatively thick films studied here.}

Figure \ref{fig:FL_va} shows the change in the shear stress, $F_L$, with logarithmic sliding velocity and Figure \ref{fig:FL_va} shows the same data as a friction coefficient, $\mu$. In general, longer chains give higher $F_L$ than shorter chains in \ref{fig:FL_va}, as expected due to their higher bulk viscosity~\cite{Zhang2017}. This trend has also been observed in previous NEMD simulations of thinner films at lower pressure~\cite{Koike1998,Sivebaek2008,Sivebaek2010,Savio2012}. The difference in $F_L$ between chain lengths decreases with increasing shear rate, such that they are almost identical at the highest shear rate studied ($\approx \SI{e10}{\per\second}$). It is important to note that tribological experiments~\cite{Ewen2017a,Zhang2017} and engineering components~\cite{Taylor2017} operate at lower shear rates than those accessible through NEMD simulations~\cite{Ewen2018}. Thus a larger increase in $F_L$ with increasing chain length can be expected under these lower shear rates than was observed here.

Generally, $F_L$ increases linearly with logarithmic shear rate in Figure \ref{fig:FL_va}, as is commonly observed for lubricants in macroscopic EHL friction experiments~\cite{Spikes2014,Ewen2017a}. Such behaviour has also been reported in previous NEMD simulations of thin (6 molecular layers) C$_{20}$ films between polymer-like surfaces at low pressure (\SI{10}{\mega\pascal})~\cite{Sivebaek2010}. In Figure \ref{fig:FL_va}, the slope of the increase in $F_L$ with shear rate generally decreases with increasing pressure. This has also been observed in NEMD simulations of linear~\cite{Ta2017} and branched~\cite{Ewen2017a} alkanes under similar conditions.

In Figure \ref{fig:Derj}, $F_0$ increases with linearly with logarithmic shear rate for all of the $n$-alkanes studied. ~\cite{Sivebaek2016}

Non-zero values for $F_0$ occur when the lubricant is less ordered.~\cite{Eder2013}

Surface effects~\cite{Ta2015a,Ta2015b}.

$n$-hexadecane~\cite{Jabbarzadeh1998} and ~\cite{Tseng2009}.

In Figure \ref{fig:FL_v1a}, $\mu$ increases with linearly with logarithmic shear rate at low pressure (0.5 GPa) for all of the $n$-alkanes studied. At higher pressure (1.0-1.5 GPa), $\mu$ still increases with shear rate for C$_{16}$, but with a shallower slope. As a result, at high shear rates, $\mu$ is higher at low pressure than at high pressure. For the longer alkanes (C$_{30}$-C$_{60}$) at high pressure, $\mu$ becomes insensitive to shear rate, in line with Coulomb's law for dry friction. The transition to this behaviour, above the limiting shear stress (LSS), has been observed for several model lubricants in macroscopic friction experiments~\cite{Martinie2016a}. It has also been observed for bulky traction fluid molecules in NEMD simulations~\cite{Ewen2017a,Porras-Vazquez2018}. Similar behaviour has also been reported in previous NEMD simulations of thin C$_{60}$ films between polymer-like surfaces at low pressure (\SI{10}{\mega\pascal}) which showed boundary slip~\cite{Sivebaek2010}.

LSS behaviour has been attributed to a range of effects, including the glass transition~\cite{Porras-Vazquez2018} and the consequent change in flow behaviour.~\cite{Ewen2017a} In this study, non-linear flow profiles occur at the onset of shear for several of the systems and conditions studied; however, a Couette profile usually develops once a nonequilibrium steady state is reached (see Appendix). However, non-linear flow persists into the steady state for some of the systems and conditions studied (Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}). For example, boundary slip occurs at the highest shear rates studied (Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}) for C$_{60}$, which has been shown to reduce $\mu$~\cite{Sivebaek2010,Savio2012}. Moreover, the longer $n$-alkanes (C$_{30}$-C$_{60}$) show CL at high pressure, which has also been linked to the LSS~\cite{Ewen2017a}. However, LSS behaviour is also observed in these simulations for systems and conditions in which the flow remains Couette-like.

EHL conditions can lead to large temperature rises in the fluid film as well as at the sliding surfaces~\cite{Spikes2014}. Figure \ref{fig:T_v} shows the change in average film temperature (details in Appendix) with logarithmic shear rate. At the lowest shear rate studied, the temperature in the fluid region is the same as the thermostatted surfaces (\SI{353}{\kelvin}). As predicted by the Archard equation for EHL temperature rise~\cite{Archard1959}, there is a linear increase in temperature with increasing sliding velocity (inset in Figure~\ref{fig:T_v}). The temperature rise is insensitive to chain length and pressure in the ranges studied. Under similar conditions, $\Delta$T is significantly larger than in previous NEMD simulations of thinner $n$-alkane films~\cite{Berro2011,Ta2017}. Moreover, the `critical shear rate' at which a detectable $\Delta$T occurs is much lower than in these simulations. These observations are expected since thicker films mean that phonons generated in the centre of the film during shearing have further to travel before they can be dissipated through the thermostatted surfaces. Indeed, the Archard equation predicts a linear increase in temperature rise with film thickness~\cite{Archard1959}. The $\Delta$T values in Figure~\ref{fig:T_v} are smaller than in recent NEMD simulations of thicker films of branched and cyclic alkanes which give higher $\tau$~\cite{Ewen2019}.

The increase of the temperature at high shear rates will decrease the fluid viscosity which will in turn reduce friction. However, the rather modest $\Delta$T values in Figure \ref{fig:T_v} are insufficient to explain the drastic changes in friction behaviour shown in Figure \ref{fig:FL_v1a}~\cite{Berro2011,Ewen2019}. However, the solid-like films at high pressure become more liquid-like at high shear rates. The reduction in $\left<P_{2}^{xz} \right> $ and $\left< R^2 \right>$ with increasing shear rate (Figures \ref{fig:e2e2_v} and \ref{fig:P2_v}) indicate that the chains are less elongated and less orientated with the flow direction, which is indicative of more liquid-like behaviour. Moreover, the radial distribution functions (RDFs) shown in Figure \ref{fig:RDF}) indicate that there is less long range order at higher shear rates, further suggesting more liquid-like films. Thus, in addition to changes in flow behaviour, shear heating and the consequent transition from solid-like to liquid-like films with increasing shear rate could also contribute to the LSS behaviour observed in Figure \ref{fig:FL_v1a}.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conc}

In this study, the behaviour of $n$-alkane films confined ($\geq 16$ molecular layers) and sheared between atomically-smooth hematite slabs has been investigated under EHL conditions using NEMD simulations. The effect of the alkane chain length (C$_{16}$-C$_{60}$), pressure ($0.5$-$1.5~\SI{}{\giga\pascal}$), and shear rate ($10^{9}$-$10^{10}~\SI{}{\per\second}$) on the chain extension and orientation, film structure and flow, shear heating, and friction have been studied. An accurate all-atom force-field was used to ensure that the viscosity was close to the experimental value.

Starting from ordered chains, a heat-quench cycle was used to equilibrate the systems by monitoring the end-to-end distance and radius of gyration. It was also ensured that the chains moved at least their own size by monitoring the mean square displacement. When shear was applied, the end-to-end distance, segmental orientation, and friction were monitored to determine when a nonequilibrium steady state had been attained. The simulation results were in agreement with previous experiments which suggested that the evolution to steady state sliding in $n$-alkane films is governed by the sliding distance rather than the sliding time.

At higher pressure, the films show more layering and ordering in the mass density profiles and RDF respectively, suggesting that they become more solid-like. Conversely, at higher shear rates, the chains become less elongated, aligned, layered, and ordered; indicating the films become more liquid-like as the fluid film temperature rise increases. Longer chains are generally more solid-like, in accordance with their higher melting point.

For all of the systems and conditions studied, the shear stress increases linearly with increasing pressure. Longer chains, with higher viscosity give higher friction, particularly at low shear rates where the films remain solid-like. The shear stress is more sensitive to pressure than to chain length in the ranges studied. For short chains, the flow remains mostly Couette-like, but some boundary slip occurs at the highest pressures and shear rates studied. Conversely, longer chains consistently show non-linear flow (both boundary slip and CL) even under comparatively mild conditions. 

At low pressure, the friction coefficient increases linearly with logarithmic shear rate, as is commonly observed for lubricants in experiments and simulations. For short chains, the slope of this increase becomes shallower as the pressure increases. For longer chains, the friction coefficient becomes insensitive to shear rate at high pressure, suggesting that the LSS was reached. A detailed study of the fluid properties reveals that a combination of non-linear flow and shear-induced melting are responsible for this behaviour for the systems and conditions studied here.

The results of this study suggest that $n$-alkanes can show deviations from the commonly assumed flow and friction behaviour at high pressure and shear rate. These deviations are more significant for longer $n$-alkanes, which have higher viscosity and melting points.

\section{Definitions}

\subsection{Segmental Orientation}

In MD simulations using atomically-detailed force-fields, the segmental orientation of $n$-alkane chains can be monitored through the orientation of the chemical bonds. The segmental orientation \cite{Erman1985} of the fluid in terms of the second Legendre polynomial $\left<P_2\right>$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:P_2}
\left\langle P_2 \right\rangle =\frac{3\left\langle \cos ^2 \alpha \right\rangle - 1}{2},
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha$ is the angle between a chain segment and a reference axis. In practice, $\left\langle \cos ^2 \alpha \right\rangle$ is calculated in the following way:

\begin{equation}
\left\langle \cos ^2 \alpha \right\rangle = \frac{1}{N_\text{bonds}} \sum_{b=1}^{N_\text{bonds}} \left(\frac{\textbf{r}^b_{ij}}{r^b_{ij}} \cdot \mathbf{\hat \imath} \right)^2
\end{equation}

 in which $N_\text{bonds}$ is the total number of bonds, $\textbf{r}^b_{ij}$ is the difference between the positions of the two beads that form the bond $b$, and $\mathbf{\hat \imath}$ is the direction of the main axis. 
 
 In this study, the changes of the orientation in the shearing direction are monitored, through the segmental orientation with respect to $x$ projected in the $xz$ plane: $\langle P_{2}^{xy}\rangle$. Note that, by definition,  if all the chains are parallel to the shearing direction $\langle P_{2}^{xz}\rangle=1 $; if all the chains are perpendicular to the surfaces $\langle P_{2}^{xz} \rangle=-0.5$, and, interestingly, if all the chains are oriented at \SI{45}{\degree} or if they are randomly oriented $\langle P_{2}^{xz}\rangle=0.25 $
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{End-to-end distance}

The mean square end-to-end distance of a single chain is defined as the square  of the magnitude of the vector that points from one end of a chain to the other end. For a system containing several chains, the mean square end-to-end distance, $\left< R^2 \right>$, is given by the following equation~\cite{Brown1994}:

\begin{equation}
	\left< R^2 \right> = \left<\left( \mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_N \right)^2\right>
	\label{eq:e2e2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where, for each chain,  $N$ is the number of atoms and  $ \mathbf{r}_i$ is the position vector of atom $i$. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Radius of gyration}

The mean square radius of gyration $\left(\left< S^2 \right>\right)$  is the average squared distance of each atom in the $n$-alkane chain  from its centre of mass, as defined in the following equation\cite{Brown1994}:

\begin{equation}
	\left< S^2 \right> = \frac{\left< \sum_{i=1}^{N}  \left ( \lVert \mathbf{r}_i - \mathbf{r}_{\text{com}} \rVert \right)^2 \right>}{N}
\end{equation}

\noindent where, for each chain,  $N$ is the number of atoms, $ \mathbf{r}_i$ is the position vector of atom $i$  and $\mathbf{r}_{\text{com}}$ is the centre of mass. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Mean squared displacement}

The mean squared displacement (MSD) of an atom  is a measure of the deviation between its current and its initial position. The MSD is usually averaged over the number of atoms  $\left(N\right)$ and its slope when plotted over time can be used to quantify the diffusion coefficient~\cite{Auhl2003}. The MSD is defined as:

\begin{equation}
	\text{MSD} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left( \mathbf{r}_i\left(t\right)-\mathbf{r}_i\left(0\right)\right)^2
\end{equation}

\noindent where   $\mathbf{r}_i\left(t\right)$ is a vector containing the coordinates of atom $i$ at time $t$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Average film temperature}

As common in NEMD simulations, the temperature of the lubricant is calculated via the kinetic energy of the atoms but excluding the velocity component in the direction of sliding (\emph{x}) to avoid contributions that are not related to the thermal vibration of the atoms~\cite{Gattinoni2013}. The measurements are block-averaged every \SI{100}{\femto\second}, the $\Delta$T values shown in Figure \ref{fig:T_v} are the time-averaged values from the final \SI{1}{\nano\second} of the sliding phase.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Equilibration}

Figure \ref{fig:Steps} shows the stages involved in the simulation procedure. Starting from an artificially ordered chains, the a heat-quench cycle is used to equilibrate the system, followed by compression and shear (see \ref{method}). Further details regarding the equilibration are shown below.

The evolution of $\left< R^2 \right>$ and $\left< S^2 \right>$ for C$_{16}$, C$_{30}$ and C$_{60}$ at \SI{2000}{\kelvin} are presented on the main part of Figures \ref{fig:e2e2} and \ref{fig:rg2}. For the case of C$_{60}$, which has lower diffusivity, these two quantities reach a steady state after approximately \SI{2e5}{} steps (\SI{0.2}{\nano\second}). The insets of the figures show the evolution of the same quantities after reducing the temperature to \SI{353}{\kelvin}; after \SI{1e7}{} steps (\SI{10}{\nano\second}), both $\left< R^2 \right>$ and $\left< S^2 \right>$ have reached their equilibrium values for the three chain lengths considered.

The last criterion, is based on the fact that systems of long chain alkanes that are not properly equilibrated can present deformation on short length scales, and this deformation is only relaxed after the chains have moved at least their own size~\cite{Auhl2003}. In order to verify this, the mean squared displacement (MSD) for the individual atoms $\left(\text{MSD}_{\text{atom}}\right)$ and for the centre of mass of the $n$-alkane chains $\left(\text{MSD}_{\text{CG}}\right)$ were followed during equilibration. 

Figure \ref{fig:msd} shows the $\text{MSD}_{\text{atom}}$ and $\text{MSD}_{\text{CG}}$ for the three different systems. The main plot is dedicated to the evolution at \SI{2000}{\kelvin}, with the inset showing the evolution at \SI{353}{\kelvin}. Note that due to the artificial way that the chains are first introduced into the system (see Figure \ref{fig:Steps}), the diffusivity of the longer chains is initially higher than that of the shorter chains.  If we take the length of a C$_{60}$ chain to be $\approx$ \SI{74}{\angstrom} (the angle between the C-C bonds is \SI{109.5}{\degree} and the C-C distance equal to \SI{1.54}{\angstrom}),  it can be seen that the chains move their own size after $\approx$ \SI{3e6}{} to \SI{4e6}{} steps (\SI{3}{\nano\second} to \SI{4}{\nano\second}). Taking a conservative approach, the systems are equilibrated for \SI{1e7}{} steps (\SI{10}{\nano\second}). The insets show the evolution after the temperature has been decreased; here, as expected, the slope of the $\text{MSD}_{\text{atom}}$ and $\text{MSD}_{\text{CG}}$ curves is shallower than at higher temperatures.

\section{Transient Velocity Profiles}

A representative example of transient deviations from Couette flow at the onset of shear is shown for C$_{30}$, \SI{1.0}{\giga\pascal} and  \SI{50}{\meter\per\second} in Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP}. Most systems eventually show Couette flow, but no$n$-linear flow persists into the steady state for some of the systems and conditions studied (Figure \ref{fig:VelProf_MDP2}).

\section{Effective Viscosity}

The effective viscosity of the lubricant was calculated as the ratio between the lateral friction force $\left(F_L\right)$ and the shear rate $\left(\dot{\gamma}\right)$. The shear rate was calculated as the ratio of the shearing velocity and the thickness of the fluid region after steady state is reached. 

In Figure \ref{fig:eta_v} we present the measured values of the effective viscosity as a function of the shear rate for all the systems considered in this work.   As already seen by other authors in the literature, increasing the velocity results in a reduced effective viscosity, showing that thin films exhibit shear thinning\cite{Sivebaek2012}. It is also interesting to see that the logarithms of the two plotted quantities present a linear relation.
