While temperature effects on the glass transition have been extensively studied under ambient pressure, the impact of pressure on molecular mobility at ambient temperature has received less attention. In this work, we use a combination of equilibrium and nonequilibrium molecular simulation methods to determine the viscosity of 2,2,4-trimethylhexane at 293 K and for pressures ranging from 0.1 MPa to 1 GPa, shedding light on the interplay between structural, thermodynamic and transport properties, leading to the increase in viscosity by several orders of magnitude at high pressure.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the behavior of n-decane under sub-10 nm confinement between two gold {\{}111{\}} surfaces. This confinement and dielectric medium are characteristic of those used in nanoscale electromachining (nano-EM) processes; thus, it is important that the behavior of the nanoconfined dielectric medium be investigated for better process understanding. Results obtained via MD simulations indicate that, when confined down to a thickness less than 1 nm, the mechanical boundary conditions trigger organization in the n-decane medium, resulting in two distinct molecular layers. The n-decane chains lie flat on the {\{}111{\}} gold surfaces and show preferred orientation in the close-packed 110 crystallographic directions. A 4-fold increase in the maximum local density as compared with the experimental bulk (liquid) density is observed at the interface between the molecular medium and the gold {\{}111{\}} surfaces, regardless of confinement spacing. Radial distribution function curves are used to quantitatively examine organization of the medium into molecular layers. The deliberate introduction of ledges (atomic steps) on the gold surface triggers a preferred alignment of the n-decane chains toward the boundaries of the ledges.},

abstract = {We report computation results obtained from extensive coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations of amorphous ensembles of polymer chains at constant density. In our polymer model, we use bending and torsion potentials acting along the polymer backbone to control the chain stiffness. The static and dynamic properties of the polymer bulk have been analyzed over a large temperature interval in search for the onset of the glass transition. The glass transition temperatures Tg, for different types of chain stiffness, have been determined from the dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient D on the temperature T as the limiting value where the diffusion vanishes. Increasing the chain stiffness induces an increase of the glass transition temperature. The Tg values estimated from diffusion are confirmed by analyzing the relaxation times of the autocorrelation functions for the torsion angle and for the end-to-end vector. The dependence of the diffusion coefficient D on the chain length N is strongly affected by temperature for chains with bending and torsion stiffness. For systems with relatively short chains (N{\textless}or=50), the exponent nu from D proportional to N(-nu) increases from the value nu approximately 1 expected in the Rouse regime to nu approximately 2 as the temperature is lowered towards Tg.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the thermodynamic driving force for the experimentally observed accumulation of C in ferritic layers of severely plastically deformed pearlitic wires, the stabilities of C interstitials in ferrite and of C vacancies in cementite are investigated as a function of uniaxial stain, using density-functional theory. In the presence of an applied strain along [1 1 0] or [1 1 1], the C interstitial in ferrite is significantly stabilized, while the C vacancy in cementite is moderately destabilized by the corresponding strain states in cementite [1 0 0] and ([0 1 0]). The enhanced stabilization of the C interstitial gives rise to an increase in the C concentration within the ferritic layers by up to two orders of magnitude. Our results thus suggest that in addition to the generally assumed non-equilibrium, dislocation-based mechanism, there is also a strain-induced thermodynamic driving force for the experimentally observed accumulation of C in ferrite. {\textcopyright} 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

Straightforwardly, using both characteristic values of a zero-shear-rate viscosity and critical shear rate, eta-gamma flow curves are well normalized to achieve the temperature-, pressure-, and density-invariant master curves, which can be formulary described by the Carreau-Yasuda rheological constitutive equation. Variations in the rate of shear thinning, obviously exhibiting in eta-gamma, psi(1)-gamma, and -psi(2)-gamma relationships, under different T, P, and rho values, are concretely revealed through the power-law model's exponent. More importantly, at low shear rates, the fluid explicitly possesses Newtonian fluidic characteristics according to both manifestations; first and second normal stress differences decay to near zero, while nonequilibrium states are close to equilibrium ones. Significantly, the tendency to vary of the degree of shear thinning in rheology is qualitatively contrary to that of shear dilatancy in thermodynamics. In addition, a convergent transition point is evidently observed in the -psi(2)/psi(1)-gamma curves undergoing dramatic variations, which should be associated with shear dilatancy, as addressed analytically.},

An effective potential derived from density functional theory calculation was utilized for the interfacial interaction between hexadecane and the tribo-surfaces. A quantitative surface parameterization was introduced to investigate the influence of surface properties on the structure, rheological properties, and tribological performance of the lubricant. The results show that although the wall-fluid attraction of hexadecane on pure iron surfaces is significantly stronger than its oxides, there is a considerable reduction of shear stress of confined n-hexadecane film between Fe(100) and Fe(110) surfaces compared with FeO(110), FeO(111), Fe2O3(001), and Fe2O3(012).

abstract = {Carbon atoms are always present in Fe-based materials, either as impurities even in high purity samples or as an intrinsic constituent in steels. Density Functional Theory calculations have been performed to study the interaction between C atoms and vacancies (V) in $\alpha$-Fe. We find that the formation of VCn complexes is energetically favourable for n ≤ 3, with VC2 being the most stable one. The energy gain corresponding to the clustering reaction VCn-1 + C → VCn depends mainly on the strength of C-C covalent bonds. The vacancy diffusivity is shown to be significantly modified by the formation of vacancy-carbon complexes, exhibiting non-Arrhenius behaviour. Effective vacancy diffusion coefficients in $\alpha$-Fe are calculated as a function of temperature and carbon content using a simplified thermodynamic model. The results are discussed in detail in the limiting case of excess of C with respect to vacancies.},

abstract = {Iron carbides play a crucial role in steel manufacturing and processing and to a large extent determine the physical properties of steel products. The modified embedded atom method (MEAM) in combination with Lee's Fe-C potential is a good candidate for molecular dynamics simulations on larger Fe-C systems. Here, we investigate the stability and crystal structures of pure iron and binary iron carbides using MEAM and compare them with the experimental data and quantum-mechanical density functional theory calculations. The analysis shows that the Fe-C potential gives reasonable results for the relative stability of iron and iron carbides. The performance of MEAM for the prediction of the potential energy and the calculated lattice parameters at elevated temperature for pure iron phases and cementite are investigated as well. The conclusion is that Lee's MEAM Fe-C potential provides a promising basis for further molecular dynamics simulations of Fe-C alloys and steels at lower temperatures (up to 800 K).},

Papers published from 2007 to 2017 were reviewed and keywords were used to identify 20 articles spanning the most prominent machine learning algorithms. Most articles reviewed consisted of training data obtained from sensors attached to the equipment. The training of the machine learning algorithm consisted of designed experiments to simulate different faulty and normal processing conditions. The areas of application varied from wear of cutting tool in computer numeric control (CNC) machine, surface roughness fault, to wafer etching process in semiconductor manufacturing. In all cases, high fault classification rates were obtained. As the interest in smart manufacturing increases, this review serves to address one of the cornerstones of emerging production systems. {\&}copy; IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.},

Understanding the root cause of an observed symptom in a complex system has been a major problem for decades. As industry dives into the IoT world and the amount of data generated per year grows at an amazing speed, an important question is how to find appropriate mechanisms to determine root causes that can handle huge amounts of data or may provide valuable feedback in real-time. While many survey papers aim at summarizing the landscape of techniques for modelling system behavior and infering the root cause of a problem based in the resulting models, none of those focuses on analyzing how the different techniques in the literature fit growing requirements in terms of performance and scalability. In this survey, we provide a review of root-cause analysis, focusing on these particular aspects.

abstract = {Density functional calculations are used to investigate hydrogen (H) behaviors in vanadium carbide (VC). Molecular H2 dissociation, atomic H diffusion and penetration are analyzed using the transition state theory. H2 prefers to be close to the surface as physical adsorption, providing an environment conducive for further dissociation, and dissociates into atomic H adsorbed at the top C atom sites with co-adsorption state. The dissociation rate on the surface is mainly limited by the temperature-controlled activation energy barrier. The adsorptivity of atomic H by the surface tends to decrease as increasing of H coverage. For atomic H penetration through the surface, a significantly endothermic energy barrier and the low diffusion prefactor suggest that the main resistant effect of H permeation takes place at the surface. Energetic, vibrational, electronic consequences, and quantum effects on the H behaviors are discussed thoroughly. Our theoretical investigation indicates VC is a promising hydrogen permeation barrier.},

@article{Feltner1967,
abstract = {In Part I, we have investigated the effects of four variables, namely, slip character, prior history, temperature and amplitude (giving lives of {\textless}104 cycles), on the hysteresis loop shape, the cyclic strain hardening and softening curves, and the cyclic stress-strain curves of copper and Cu-7.5{\%} Al. In the present paper the dislocation structures associated with the cyclic stress-strain measurements in Part I have been studied by transmission electron microscopy. In copper, cell structures the size of which increases with both increase of temperature and decrease of amplitude were observed. On the other hand, the Cu-7.5{\%} Al alloy showed dense bands of dislocations interspersed with dislocations distributed generally. The cell structures in copper were found to be independent of the initial condition of the material, whereas the structures in Cu-7.5{\%} Al depended appreciably on initial material condition. The major conclusion drawn from these experiments and those of Part I is that for wavy slip mode materials like pure copper subjected to large cyclic plastic strains, a cyclic mechanical equation of state $\sigma$ = f($\Delta$$\epsilon$v, $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}} ̇, T) is approximated (after passing through a transient) in which the saturation stress unique function of the plastic strain range, strain rate and temperature, independent of the prior strain history. Planar slip mode materials like Cu-7.5{\%} Al on the other hand obey no such relationship and their saturation stress response depends strongly on prior history. The influence of the different variables on cyclic strain hardening and softening rates was determined in Part I. Combining these results with the observations in this paper and other evidence in the literature, we have developed a rationale for cyclic strain hardening and have elucidated the factors which either allow or control cyclic strain softening. The cyclic strain hardening rationale utilizes two ideas. The first of these requires that a distinction be made between "small" and "large" plastic strain amplitude hardening behavior. The second idea is that in f.c.c. metals distinct parallelisms exist (a) between stage I unidirectional and low amplitude cyclic strain hardening behavior and (b) between stage II unidirectional and high amplitude cyclic strain hardening behavior. From these ideas we are able to show that unidirectional and cyclic strain hardening mechanisms are largely similar and that cyclically straining a crystal only serves to accentuate those dislocation processes leading to unidirectional strain hardening. We have shown that a prerequisite to cyclic strain softening is reversed plastic strain. This in itself, however, is not sufficient for the complete reversion of an alien dislocation structure to one characteristic of the cyclic state. Incomplete reversion of the alien dislocation structure results when the reversed plastic strain is small and when cross slip is difficult. Further, the rate of cyclic strain softening is found to be controlled by frictional type impediments (jogs etc.) to the mobile dislocation. Finally our model of the high amplitude saturation flow stress employs the conceptually simple free mesh length theory as developed by Kuhlman-Wilsdorf(41) for stage II unidirectional strain hardening. Our adaptation of this model to cyclic behavior gives correct order of magnitude stress response and strain accommodation as well as explaining the instantaneous shape of the stored energy versus cumulative plastic strain curve. {\textcopyright} 1967.},

abstract = {The evolution of microstructure and the mechanical response of copper subjected to severe plastic deformation using equal channel angular pressing (ECAP) was investigated. Samples were subjected to ECAP under three different processing routes: BC, A and C. The microstructural refinement was dependent on processing with route BC being the most effective. The mechanical response is modeled by an equation containing two dislocation evolution terms: one for the cells/subgrain interiors and one for the cells/subgrain walls. The deformation structure evolves from elongated dislocation cells to subgrains to equiaxed grains with diameters of ∼200-500 nm. The misorientation between adjacent regions, measured by electron backscatter diffraction, gradually increases. The mechanical response is well represented by a Voce equation with a saturation stress of 450 MPa. Interestingly, the microstructures produced through adiabatic shear localization during high strain rate deformation and ECAP are very similar, leading to the same grain size. It is shown that both processes have very close Zener-Hollomon parameters (ln Z ∼ 25). Calculations show that grain boundaries with size of 200 nm can rotate by ∼30° during ECAP, thereby generating and retaining a steady-state equiaxed structure. This is confirmed by a grain-boundary mobility calculation which shows that their velocity is 40 nm/s for a 200 nm grain size at 350 K, which is typical of an ECAP process. This can lead to the grain-boundary movement necessary to retain an equiaxed structure. {\textcopyright} 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {The severe plastic deformation of a Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP), 0.61C-22.3Mn-0.19Si-0.14Ni-0.27Cr (wt{\%}) steel by Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) at elevated temperatures was used to study the deformation mechanism as a function of accumulated strain and processing parameters. The relationship between the microstructures after different deformation schedules of ECAP at the temperatures of 200, 300 and 400. °C, strain hardening behavior and mechanical properties was studied. The best balance between strength and ductility (1702. MPa and 24{\%}) was found after two passes at 400. °C and 300. °C of ECAP. It was due to the formation of deformation microbands and twins in the microstructure. The twinning was observed after all deformation schedules except after one pass at 400. °C. The important finding was the formation of twins in the ultrafine grains. Moreover, the stacking faults were observed in the subgrains with the size of 50. nm. It is also worth mentioning the formation of nano-twins within the micro-twins at the same time. It was found that the deformation schedule affects the dislocation substructure with formation of deformation bands, cells, subgrains, two variants of twins that, in turn, influence the strain-hardening behavior and mechanical properties. {\textcopyright} 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

The steady-state grain sizes decrease by atomic bond energy and related parameters such as specific heat capacity, activation energy for self-diffusion and homologous temperature and are reasonably independent of stacking fault energy. A good correlation exists between the hardness normalized by the shear modulus and grain size normalized by the Burgers vector, indicating that the important factor for strengthening HPT-processed pure metals is the average size of grains having high angles of misorientation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {Tantalum was subjected to high plastic strains (global effective strains between 0 and 3) at high strain rates ({\textgreater}10(4) s(-1)) in an axisymmetric plane strain configuration. Tubular specimens, embedded in thick-walled cylinders made of copper, were collapsed quasi-uniformly by explosively-generated energy; this was performed by placing the explosive charge co-axially with the thick-walled cylinder. The high strains achieved generated temperatures which produced significant microstructural change in the material; these strains and temperatures were computed as a function of radial distance from the cylinder axis. The microstructural features observed were: (i) dislocations and elongated dislocation cells (epsilon(eff) 2.5, T{\textgreater} 1000 K). Whereas the post-deformation (static) recrystallization takes place by a migrational mechanism, dynamic recrystallization is the result of the gradual rotation of subgrains coupled with dislocation annihilation. A simple analysis shows that the statically recrystallized grain sizes observed are consistent with predicted values using conventional grain-growth kinetics. The same analysis shows that the deformation time is not sufficient to generate grains of a size compatible with observation (0.1-0.3 mu m). A mechanism describing the evolution of the microstructure leading from elongated dislocation cells, to subgrains, and to micrograins is proposed. Grain-scale localization produced by anisotropic plastic flow and localized recovery and recrystallization was observed at the higher plastic strains (epsilon(eff) {\textgreater} 1). Residual tensile 'hoop' stresses are generated near the central hole region upon unloading; this resulted in ductile fracturing along shear localization bands. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.},

abstract = {When copper is deformed to high plastic strain ($\gamma$ ∼ 3∼4) at high strain rates ($\gamma$ ∼ 104s-1a microstructure with grain sizes of ∼ 0.1 $\mu$m can be produced. It is proposed that this microstructure develops by dynamic recrystallization, which is enabled by the adiabatic temperature rise. By schock-loading the material, and thereby increasing its flow stress, the propensity for dynamic recrystallization can be enhanced. The grain size-flow stress relationship observed after cessation of plastic deformation is consistent with the general formulation proposed by Derby [Acta metall. mater. 39, 955 (1991)]. The temperatures reached by the specimens during dynamic deformation are calculated from a constitutive equation and are found to be, for the shock-loaded material, in the 500-800 K range; these temperatures are consistent with static annealing experiments on shock-loaded specimens, that show the onset of static recrystallization at 523 K. A possible recrystallization mechanism is described and its effect on the mechanical response of copper is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Mohamed2003,
abstract = {Primary among the processing techniques that are now available for synthesizing bulk nanocrystalline materials is ball milling, which produces nanostructures by the structural decomposition of large-grained structures as the result of severe cyclic deformation. It is well-documented that during milling, the grain size decreases with milling time, reaching a minimum grain size, dmin, which is a characteristic of each metal. In this paper, a dislocation model that predicts the value of dmin as a function of material parameters, such as hardness, melting temperature, and stacking fault energy, has been developed. The model is based on the concept that dmin is governed by a balance between the hardening rate introduced by dislocation generation and the recovery rate arising from dislocation annihilation and recombination. It is demonstrated that the model provides possible explanations for several recent observations regarding the characteristics of dmin. {\textcopyright} 2003 Acta Materialia Inc.

We obtained a maximum concentration of 10 ± 1 at.{\%} C at T = 0 K within a radius of 1 nm from the dislocation lines. The spatial carbon distributions around the line defects revealed that the Cottrell atmosphere associated with an edge dislocation is denser than that around a screw dislocation, in contrast with the predictions of the classical model of Cochardt and colleagues.

abstract = {The size and arrangement of stromal collagen fibrils (CFs) influence the optical properties of the cornea and hence its function. The spatial arrangement of the collagen is still questionable in relation to the diameter of collagen fibril. In the present study, we introduce a new parameter, edge-fibrillar distance (EFD) to measure how two collagen fibrils are spaced with respect to their closest edges and their spatial distribution through normalized standard deviation of EFD (NSDEFD) accessed through the application of two commercially available multipurpose solutions (MPS): ReNu and Hippia. The corneal buttons were soaked separately in ReNu and Hippia MPS for five hours, fixed overnight in 2.5{\%} glutaraldehyde containing cuprolinic blue and processed for transmission electron microscopy. The electron micrographs were processed using ImageJ user-coded plugin. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the image processed equivalent diameter (ED), inter-fibrillar distance (IFD), and EFD of the CFs of treated versus normal corneas. The ReNu-soaked cornea resulted in partly degenerated epithelium with loose hemidesmosomes and Bowman's collagen. In contrast, the epithelium of the cornea soaked in Hippia was degenerated or lost but showed closely packed Bowman's collagen. Soaking the corneas in both MPS caused a statistically significant decrease in the anterior collagen fibril, ED and a significant change in IFD, and EFD than those of the untreated corneas (. p{\textless}. 0.05, for all comparisons). The introduction of EFD measurement in the study directly provided a sense of gap between periphery of the collagen bundles, their spatial distribution; and in combination with ED, they showed how the corneal collagen bundles are spaced in relation to their diameters. The spatial distribution parameter NSDEFD indicated that ReNu treated cornea fibrils were uniformly distributed spatially, followed by normal and Hippia. The EFD measurement with relatively lower standard deviation and NSDEFD, a characteristic of uniform CFs distribution, can be an additional parameter used in evaluating collagen organization and accessing the effects of various treatments on corneal health and transparency.},

The strain-induced cementite dissolution was found to be a three-stage process corresponding to the stages of nanostructure formation. The mechanism of the dissolution due to wear of cementite at the ferrite/cementite interface, followed by drag of the carbon atoms by the ferrite matrix, is discussed. The flow of carbon atoms with the ferrite phase can be considered as a mechanically driven mass transport process, quantitatively described by the mechanical diffusion parameter.},

abstract = {It is well known that microstructural changes occur in a steel bearing, when the bearing is operated under conditions involving high cyclic stresses. When combined with relatively high temperatures, such microstructural changes result in the flaking of the bearing raceway. In this paper, microstructural changes that occurred during rolling contact fatigue were investigated, and the relationship between these changes and fatigue life are discussed in association with the recrystallization behavior of martensite. Conventional bearing steel SUJ2 (SAE52100) was subjected to partial solution treatment at 1133K for 2.4ks followed by oil quenching. The quenched material with a martensitic structure was tempered at 443K for 7.2ks, and then subjected to rolling contact fatigue testing. The testing was performed at temperatures ranging from 373K to 443K and surface pressures of 4.6GPa or 5.5GPa. During testing at 373K, flaking occurred from the surface of the raceway due to non-metallic inclusion and without any marked microstructural changes. On the other hand, in the case of testing at 403K or more, flaking occurs after obvious microstructural changes. Firstly, dark etching constituent (DEC) formed around the area of maximum shear stress, which was followed by the formation of white etching constituent (WEC) within the DEC at 80 and 30 degrees to the rolling direction. TEM observations showed the change from martensite lath to dislocation cell structure within the DEC, and also the existence of fine ferrite grains of 20nm through 100nm within the WEC. Arrhenius plots for the fatigue life indicated that the activation energy of the fatigue process corresponded to that of carbon diffusion in bcc ferrite. These results suggest that rolling contact fatigue originated from the WEC is controlled by the diffusion of carbon in the ferrite matrix.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

It is demonstrated that the maximum tensile strength (in excess of 2 GPa) and ductility is achieved by the $\theta$-phase and the maximum yield strength is found during the $\alpha$′ + $\eta$ → $\alpha$′ + $\theta$ transition. The interplay between the amount of carbon in solid solution, the martensite tetragonality and its morphology are related to the precipitate/matrix strain energy, the precipitate species present and their morphology.

abstract = {Microstructural alterations in bearing steels during rolling contact cycling have been reported in the literature for more than half a century. These structural changes are primarily caused by the decay of parent martensite and have been designated as white and dark etching regions due to their preferential etching characteristics. One of the most striking features of the white etching bands is their repeatable directionality, which has puzzled investigators for decades. Despite numerous attempts, a satisfactory explanation for the orientation of these bands is still not available. In this article (Part 1), an overview of the phenomenon is presented with detailed discussion of various experimental observations from the literature. The article also examines the previous approaches adopted to explain white etching bands and address their limitations. In Part II of the article, a J2-based elastic–plastic finite element model coupled with a carbon diffusion model is developed that directionally predicts the occurrence and orientation of the white etching bands.},

abstract = {Microstructural alterations in bearing steels during rolling contact cycling have been reported in the literature for more than half a century. These structural changes are primarily caused by the decay of parent martensite and have been designated as white and dark etching regions due to their preferential etching characteristics. One of the most striking features of the white etching bands is their repeatable directionality, which has puzzled investigators for decades. Despite numerous attempts, a satisfactory explanation for the orientation of these bands is still not available. In this article (Part 1), an overview of the phenomenon is presented with detailed discussion of various experimental observations from the literature. The article also examines the previous approaches adopted to explain white etching bands and address their limitations. In Part II of the article, a J2-based elastic–plastic finite element model coupled with a carbon diffusion model is developed that directionally predicts the occurrence and orientation of the white etching bands.},

abstract = {That classical elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) is not a quantitative field can be illustrated by its failure to provide a consistent and rigorous definition of the viscosity-pressure coefficient. Indeed, if the pressure dependence of viscosity cannot be accurately described, then the viscosity-pressure coefficient cannot be defined. Classical EHL has employed fictional narratives to justify the pressure dependences that have been utilized. In this context, the purpose of this perspective article is to review specific and real needs from EHL and to show that data and models describing the viscosity-pressure dependence are already available and how they can properly be used. The final aim is to encourage researchers to change their phi-losophy of classical EHL to a quantitative approach, in which every hypothesis and every result, whether experi-mental or numerical, would be justified on the basis of acceptable physics.

abstract = {Future manufacturing of pharmaceuticals will involve innovative use of polymeric excipients. Hot melt extrusion (HME) is an already established manufacturing technique and several products based on HME are on the market. Additionally, processing based on, e.g., HME or three dimensional (3D) printing, will have an increasingly important role when designing products for flexible dosing, since dosage forms based on compacting of a given powder mixture do not enable manufacturing of optimal pharmaceutical products for personalized treatments. The melt processability of polymers and API-polymer mixtures is highly dependent on the rheological properties of these systems, and rheological measurements should be considered as a more central part of the material characterization tool box when selecting suitable candidates for melt processing by, e.g., HME or 3D printing. The polymer processing industry offers established platforms, methods, and models for rheological characterization, and they can often be readily applied in the field of pharmaceutical manufacturing. Thoroughly measured and calculated rheological parameters together with thermal and mechanical material data are needed for the process simulations which are also becoming increasingly important. The authors aim to give an overview to the basics of rheology and summarize examples of the studies where rheology has been utilized in setting up or evaluating extrusion processes. Furthermore, examples of different experimental set-ups available for rheological measurements are presented, discussing each of their typical application area, advantages and limitations.},

abstract = {Stainless steels found in real-world applications usually have some C content in the base Fe-Cr alloy, resulting in hard and dislocation-pinning carbides-Fe3C (cementite) and Cr23C6-being present in the finished steel product. The higher complexity of the steel microstructure has implications, for example, for the elastic properties and the evolution of defects such as Frenkel pairs and dislocations. This makes it necessary to re-evaluate the effects of basic radiation phenomena and not simply to rely on results obtained from purely metallic Fe-Cr alloys. In this report, an analytical interatomic potential parameterization in the Abell-Brenner-Tersoff form for the entire Fe-Cr-C system is presented to enable such calculations. The potential reproduces, for example, the lattice parameter(s), formation energies and elastic properties of the principal Fe and Cr carbides (Fe3C, Fe5C2, Fe7C3, Cr3C2, Cr7C3, Cr23C6), the Fe-Cr mixing energy curve, formation energies of simple C point defects in Fe and Cr, and the martensite lattice anisotropy, with fair to excellent agreement with empirical results. Tests of the predictive power of the potential show, for example, that Fe-Cr nanowires and bulk samples become elastically stiffer with increasing Cr and C concentrations. High-concentration nanowires also fracture at shorter relative elongations than wires made of pure Fe. Also, tests with Fe3C inclusions show that these act as obstacles for edge dislocations moving through otherwise pure Fe.},

The ab initio C-C-C-C profile of n-C4F10 (perfluorobutane) is similar to those from prior high-level calculations and indicates the presence of gauche (g) and ortho (o) minima and of anti (a) minima slightly offset from 180°. Ab initio torsional profiles for n-C5F12 (perfluoropentane) and (CF3)2CFCF2CF3 (perfluoro-2-methylbutane) also show three sets of energy minima. Special OPLS-AA torsional parameters for these three molecules closely match ab initio and experimental geometries, conformational energies (∆Emin), and conformational energy barriers. These specialized force fields were merged to provide a generalized force field for linear, branched, and cyclic perfluoroalkanes. The resultant parameters yield key ∆Emin values within 0.6 kcal/mol of the ab initio results for the three test compounds but more poorly represent the energy barriers. The parametrization also included reproduction of experimental liquid properties of these compounds, CF4 (perfluoromethane) and c-C5F10 (perfluorocyclopentane) via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. MC simulations of six additional molecules were also performed in order to test the transferability of the force field. Introduction},

abstract = {The embedded-atom method is a semi-empirical method for performing calculations of defects in metals. The EAM incorporates a picture of metallic bonding, for which there is some fundamental basis. The limitations of the EAM are fairly well characterized: it works best for purely metallic systems with no directional bonding; it does not treat covalency or significant charge transfer; and it does not handle Fermi-surface effects. The main physical property incorporated in the EAM is the moderation of bond strength by other bonds (coordination-dependent bond strength). Within these constraints, the EAM provides a very useful and robust means of calculating approximate structure and energetics, from which many interesting properties of metals can be obtained. We believe that atomistic calculations will continue to play an important role in the development of materials theory. Where the EAM can be useful, there is a tremendous number of interesting projects that have yet to be carried out. The understanding of mechanical properties on an atomistic level has only just begun. For materials where the EAM is not expected to work well, there are recent developments which may allow calculations similar to those presented here. We have mentioned already the problem of treating directional bonding in semiconductors and elements from the transition series. One approach which promises to be useful for treating directional bonding is reviewed by Carlsson [70]; the interested reader is encouraged to start there.},

@article{Onodera2010a,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {First principles calculations of the Sigma 5 (310)[001] symmetric tilt grain boundary in Cu with Bi, Na, and Ag substitutional impurities provide evidence that in the phenomenon of Bi embrittlement of Cu grain boundaries electronic effects do not play a major role; on the contrary, the embrittlement is mostly a structural or "size" effect. Na is predicted to be nearly as good an embrittler as Bi, whereas Ag does not embrittle the boundary in agreement with experiment. While we reject the prevailing view that "electronic" effects (i.e., charge transfer) are responsible for embrittlement, we do not exclude the role of chemistry. However numerical results show a striking equivalence between the alkali metal Na and the semi metal Bi, small differences being accounted for by their contrasting "size" and "softness" (defined here). In order to separate structural and chemical effects unambiguously if not uniquely, we model the embrittlement process by taking the system of grain boundary and free surfaces through a sequence of precisely defined gedanken processes; each of these representing a putative mechanism. We thereby identify three mechanisms of embrittlement by substitutional impurities, two of which survive in the case of embrittlement or cohesion enhancement by interstitials. Two of the three are purely structural and the third contains both structural and chemical elements that by their very nature cannot be further unravelled. We are able to take the systems we study through each of these stages by explicit computer simulations and assess the contribution of each to the nett reduction in intergranular cohesion. The conclusion we reach is that embrittlement by both Bi and Na is almost exclusively structural in origin; that is, the embrittlement is a size effect.},

abstract = {We have performed density functional calculations to investigate the adhesion and electronic structure at interfaces between Al and the refractory transition metal nitrides/carbides VN and VC in order to understand the significance of the ceramic's metalloid component upon interfacial properties. We find that for both systems the preferred bonding site places the metal interfacial atoms above the ceramic's metalloid atoms, and that adhesion energies are comparable to those found for other metals (Ti, Ag) on MgO. The differences in magnitude and rank-ordering of the adhesion energies for the two interfaces are rationalized in terms of the the surface energies of the ceramics. Analysis of the charge density and density of states reveals that covalent Al-C/N bonds constitute the dominant metal-ceramic interaction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

abstract = {The plastic flattening of a sinusoidal metal surface is studied by performing plane strain dislocation dynamics simulations. Plasticity arises from the collective motion of discrete dislocations of edge character. Their dynamics is incorporated through constitutive rules for nucleation, glide, pinning and annihilation. By analyzing surfaces with constant amplitude we found that the mean contact pressure is inversely proportional to the wavelength. For small wavelengths, due to interaction between plastic zones of neighboring contacts, the mean contact pressure can reach values that are about 1/10 of the theoretical strength of the material, thus significantly higher than what is predicted by simulations that do not account for size dependent plasticity. Surfaces with the same amplitude to period ratio have a size dependent response, such that if we interpret each period of the sinusoidal wave as the asperity of a rough surface, smaller asperities are harder to be flattened than large ones. The difference between the limiting situations of sticking and frictionless contacts is found to be negligible. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Butterflies are microscopic damage features forming at subsurface material imperfections induced during rolling contact fatigue (RCF) in rolling element bearings. Butterflies can lead to degradation of the load bearing capacity of the material by their associated cracks causing premature spalling failures. Recently, butterfly formation has been cited to be related to a premature failure mode in wind turbine gearbox bearings; white structure flaking (WSF). Butterflies consist of cracks with surrounding microstructural change called 'white etching area' (WEA) forming wings that revolve around their initiators. The formation mechanisms of butterflies in bearing steels have been studied over the last 50 years, but are still not fully understood. This paper presents a detailed microstructural analysis of a butterfly that has initiated from a void in standard 100Cr6 bearing steel under rolling contact fatigue on a laboratory two-roller test rig under transient operating conditions. Analysis was conducted using focused ion beam (FIB) tomography, 3D reconstruction and transmission electron microscopy (STEM/TEM) methods. FIB tomography revealed an extensive presence of voids/cavities immediately adjacent to the main crack on the non-WEA side and at the crack tip. This provides evidence for a void/cavity coalescence mechanism for the butterfly cracks formation. Spherical M3C carbide deformation and dissolution as part of the microstructural change in WEA were observed in both FIB and STEM/TEM analyses, where TEM analyses also revealed the formation of superfine nano-grains (3-15nm diameter) intersecting a dissolving spherical M3C carbide. This is evidence of the early formation of nano-grains associated with the WEA formation mechanism. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The friction of surfaces moving relative to each other must derive$\backslash$nfrom the atomic interaction at interfaces. However, recent experiments$\backslash$nbring into question the fundamental understanding of this phenomenon.$\backslash$nThe analytic theories predict that most perfect clean incommensurate$\backslash$ninterfaces would produce no static friction, whereas commensurate$\backslash$naligned surfaces would have very high friction. In contrast recent$\backslash$nexperiments show that the static friction coefficient between clean$\backslash$nbut 45{\^{A}}° misoriented Ni(001) surfaces is only a factor of 4 smaller$\backslash$nthan for the aligned surfaces ({\^{I}}¸{\^{a}}¼0{\^{A}}°) and clearly does not vanish$\backslash$n({\^{I}}¸ is defined as the rotation angle between the relative crystallographic$\backslash$norientations of two parallel surfaces). To understand this friction$\backslash$nanisotropy and the difference between analytic theory and experiment,$\backslash$nwe carried out a series of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations$\backslash$nat 300 K for sliding of Ni(001)/Ni(001) interfaces under a constant$\backslash$nshear force. Our molecular dynamics calculations on interfaces with$\backslash$nthe top layer roughed (and rms roughness of 0.8 {\~{A}}) lead to the static$\backslash$nfrictional coefficients in good agreement with the corresponding$\backslash$nexperimental data. On the other hand, perfect smooth surfaces (rms$\backslash$nroughness of 0 {\~{A}}) lead to a factor of 34{\^{a}}330 decreasing of static$\backslash$nfriction coefficients for misaligned surfaces, a result more consistent$\backslash$nwith the analytic theories. This shows that the major source of the$\backslash$ndiscrepancy is that small amounts of roughness dramatically increase$\backslash$nthe friction on incommensurate surfaces, so that misaligned directions$\backslash$nare comparable to aligned directions.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter outlines the historical perspective and the present status of refractory carbides and nitrides. Refractory carbides and nitrides are materials with a high melting point, arbitrarily selected as greater than 1800°C and must have a high degree of chemical stability. Carbides and nitrides can be divided into several types depending on their different physicochemical structures and characteristics. However, only the interstitial and covalent materials meet the refractory qualification. This includes the carbides and nitrides of the nine transition elements of Groups IV, V, and {\{}{\{}{\}}VI{\{}{\}}{\}} and the 4th, 5th, and 6th Periods, the carbides and nitrides of boron and silicon, and aluminum nitride. Refractory carbides and nitrides are useful materials with numerous industrial applications and a promising future, in addition to being materials of great interest to the scientific community. The industrial importance of the refractory carbides and nitrides is growing rapidly in the traditional and well-established applications based on the strength and refractory nature of these materials such as cutting tools and abrasives, as well as in the new and promising fields such as electronics and opto-electronics. },

abstract = {Atomic-level modeling of materials provides fundamental insights into phase stability, structure and properties of crystalline defects, and to physical mechanisms of many processes ranging from atomic diffusion to interface migration. This knowledge often serves as a guide for the development of mesoscopic and macroscopic continuum models, with input parameters provided by atomistic models. This paper gives an overview of the most recent developments in the area of atomistic modeling with emphasis on interfaces and their impact on microstructure and properties of materials. Modern computer simulation methodologies are discussed and illustrated by several applications related to thermodynamic, kinetic and mechanical properties of materials.

It was found that the experimental conditions can significantly influence the TDS results.

abstract = {First principle calculations were used to study the hydrogen migration properties in bulk bcc tungsten. Hydrogen has low solubility in tungsten and occupies the tetrahedral interstitial site with an energy difference of 0.38 eV compared to the octahedral interstitial site. The hydrogen diffusion coefficient was evaluated using the harmonic transition state theory and was found to agree with the experimental results at temperatures above 1500 K. The height of the migration barrier between two adjacent tetrahedral sites was found to be 0.21 eV, which is lower than the value 0.39 eV obtained for the migration barrier from degassing measurements in the temperature range between 1100 and 2400 K. The tunneling correction to the diffusion rate provides much better agreement with the experimental result at 29 K than the extrapolated experimental D from high temperature measurements.},

One major class of multi-scale models directly couples a region described with full atomistic detail to a surrounding region modelled using continuum concepts and finite element methods. Here, the development of such coupled atomistic/continuum models is reviewed within a single coherent framework with the aim of providing both non-specialists and specialists with insight into the key ideas, features, differences and advantages of prevailing models.

abstract = {Simulations of friction between clean, atomically flat surfaces indicate that the friction force per unit area decreases to zero with increasing area. In previous work, we showed that the presence of mobile atoms between surfaces suppresses this superlubric behavior. The current paper examines the effect of atomic scale roughness. Both single asperities and random self-affine surfaces are considered in two and three-dimensional geometries. We have also examined the effect of commensurability, and elastic or plastic deformation within the bounding solids. The friction force on single asperities decreases to zero as the contact area and radius of curvature increase, but can still be significant at the scale of scanning probe tips. Introducing mobile atoms leads to friction forces that rise linearly with area in large contacts. Frictional forces on random self-affine surfaces can be quite complex. If self-affine scaling extends down to atomic dimensions, the average contact between elastic solids only contains a few atoms and the friction can be large. Plasticity increases contact dimensions and may lower the friction. Copyright 2005 by ASME.},

abstract = {Simulations of phase separation under oscillatory shear flow have been performed based on the time-dependent Ginzburg?Landau (TDGL) equation. To calculate the stress tensor, the expression proposed by Kawasaki was used. The results of the simulations have been confronted directly with experimental results on a LCST blend of P$\alpha$MSAN/PMMA to evaluate the potential of the simulations. The effect of quench depth, shear amplitude, and shear frequency on the morphology development as well as on the corresponding rheological properties has been investigated. The results show that the characteristic rheological behavior of phase-separating systems can be attributed to the interfacial relaxation, which is changing during the process of phase separation. The strength of the concentration fluctuations and the interfacial volume fraction are key factors determining the contribution of interfacial relaxation to the global rheological behavior of the blend. In the low frequency range, the oscillatory shear cannot affect the critical point, but it can accelerate the coagulation and growth of the blend morphology. The simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental findings.},

@article{Becker1981,
abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

They range from thermodynamic modelling based on empirical correlations, through the image model of adhesion, semi-empirical tight-binding calculations, to first- principles calculations based on applying the density functional theory or Hartree–Fock theory. This article reviews the present state of theoretical calculations, with particular reference to electronic structure and adhesion. A section on the thermodynamic background clarifies the concept of work of adhesion which is the goal of many calculations. Cluster models and periodic slabs have been considered, both self-consistent and non-self-consistent. The most sophisticated and complete calculations have been made for metals on MgO and alumina. There a consistent picture of the nature of the bonding has emerged, although there are still significant unexplained discrepancies in numerical values.},

Three-dimensional simulations of hopper flow show that the nonconvexity of the particles strongly affects the jamming on granular flow.

It goes beyond Oriani's by taking into account, in a simple way, the connectivity between interstitial trap sites. It shows, in particular, that the typical dimension of a network of trap sites, connected by low barriers, appears squared in the diffusion coefficient. Therefore, a large precipitate can be inefficient if it offers a fast diffusion path, even if each individual trap site is deep. The model is illustrated in the case of hydrogen trapping at vacancies in Ni, using ab initio calculations for migration barriers and Kinetic Monte Carlo for validation. Trapping/detrapping kinetic parameters for "Thermal Desorption Spectra" analysis are also given.},

The contact area and normal stiffness rise linearly with the applied load, and the load rises exponentially with decreasing separation between surfaces. Results for a wide range of roughness, system size, and Poisson ratio can be collapsed using Persson's contact theory for continuous elastic media. The compliance due to atomic-scale motion at the interface between solids has little effect on the area and normal stiffness, but can reduce the total transverse stiffness by orders of magnitude. The scaling of this effect with system size is discussed.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND: The Avogadro project has developed an advanced molecule editor and visualizer designed for cross-platform use in computational chemistry, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related areas. It offers flexible, high quality rendering, and a powerful plugin architecture. Typical uses include building molecular structures, formatting input files, and analyzing output of a wide variety of computational chemistry packages. By using the CML file format as its native document type, Avogadro seeks to enhance the semantic accessibility of chemical data types. RESULTS: The work presented here details the Avogadro library, which is a framework providing a code library and application programming interface (API) with three-dimensional visualization capabilities; and has direct applications to research and education in the fields of chemistry, physics, materials science, and biology. The Avogadro application provides a rich graphical interface using dynamically loaded plugins through the library itself. The application and library can each be extended by implementing a plugin module in C++ or Python to explore different visualization techniques, build/manipulate molecular structures, and interact with other programs. We describe some example extensions, one which uses a genetic algorithm to find stable crystal structures, and one which interfaces with the PackMol program to create packed, solvated structures for molecular dynamics simulations. The 1.0 release series of Avogadro is the main focus of the results discussed here. CONCLUSIONS: Avogadro offers a semantic chemical builder and platform for visualization and analysis. For users, it offers an easy-to-use builder, integrated support for downloading from common databases such as PubChem and the Protein Data Bank, extracting chemical data from a wide variety of formats, including computational chemistry output, and native, semantic support for the CML file format. For developers, it can be easily extended via a powerful plugin mechanism to support new features in organic chemistry, inorganic complexes, drug design, materials, biomolecules, and simulations.

@article{Onodera2010,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Different temperatures (0-400 K) are studied, while roughness and applied load are changed. During sliding, we observe an exponential decrease in surface roughness. It appears that the initial surface roughness is dominating the friction, and that temperature has only a secondary effect for the studied parameter range. Nonetheless, in the case of non-negligible adhesion, friction decreases with temperature, but with limited adhesion and non-commensurate lattice alignments, we measure the opposite effect due to thermal oscillations of surface atoms. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {It is generally accepted that the rolling contact fatigue (RCF) life of bearing components is strongly reduced when the hardened steel matrix contains hydrogen. Although frequently reported in the literature, a physically sound explanation to this phenomenon has not yet been presented. In recent work on building understanding around the nature of the RCF damage process, we have reported on the development of a physically based fatigue damage model. Here we discuss an attempt to interpret the role of hydrogen on the micro-plastic fatigue damage mechanism on the basis of this concept. In this context, the role of hydrogen on the RCF response has been studied in order to find evidence for and to determine its weakening effect on hardened and low-temperature tempered (bearing) steels. In order to perform valid tests, effort was put in controlling the hydrogen content in bearing components before testing using an electrochemical hydrogen charging process. A number of bearing tests were performed clearly showing differences in fatigue response with different amounts of hydrogen present in the microstructure. The results of testing of bearings with hydrogen-containing steel matrices are given. It was found that increased hydrogen content in bearing steel at 5 ppm (by weight) will significantly promote bearing spalling failure and enhance the formation and growth of so-called white-etching crack systems. This experimental information is interpreted in the light of the physically based fatigue damage model.},

abstract = {The indentation of single crystals by a periodic array of flat rigid contacts is analyzed using discrete dislocation plasticity. Plane strain analyses are carried out with the dislocations all of edge character and modeled as line singularities in a linear elastic solid. The limiting cases of frictionless and perfectly sticking contacts are considered. The effects of contact size, dislocation source density, and dislocation obstacle density and strength on the evolution of the mean indentation pressure are explored, but the main focus is on contrasting the response of crystals having dislocation sources on the surface with that of crystals having dislocation sources in the bulk. When there are only bulk sources, the mean contact pressure for sufficiently large contacts is independent of the friction condition, whereas for sufficiently small contact sizes, there is a significant dependence on the friction condition. When there are only surface dislocation sources the mean contact pressure increases much more rapidly with indentation depth than when bulk sources are present and the mean contact pressure is very sensitive to the strength of the obstacles to dislocation glide. Also, on unloading a layer of tensile residual stress develops when surface dislocation sources dominate. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present the derivation of a new molecular mechanical force field for simulating the structures, conformational energies, and interaction energies of proteins, nucleic acids, and many related organic molecules in condensed phases. This effective two-body force field is the successor to the Weiner et al. force field and was developed with some of the same philosophies, such as the use of a simple diagonal potential function and electrostatic potential fit atom centered charges. The need for a 10-12 function for representing hydrogen bonds is no longer necessary due to the improved performance of the new charge model and new van der Waals parameters. These new charges are determined using a 6-31G basis set and restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting and have been shown to reproduce interaction energies, free energies of solvation, and conformational energies of simple small molecules to a good degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the new RESP charges exhibit less variability as a function of the molecular conformation used in the charge determination. The new van der Waals parameters have been derived from liquid simulations and include hydrogen parameters which take into account the effects of any geminal electronegative atoms. The bonded parameters developed by Weiner et al. were modified as necessary to reproduce experimental vibrational frequencies and structures. Most of the simple dihedral parameters have been retained from Weiner et al., but a complex set of 4 and yj parameters which do a good job of reproducing the energies of the low-energy conformations of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides has been developed for the peptide backbone.},

abstract = {Tribofilms formed under boundary lubrication from ZDDP and MoDTC additives alone or in different ratios in the lubricant have been studied. The tribological performance is linked to the tribofilm properties and consequently to the lubricating conditions. Tribofilms are formed using a reciprocating pin-on-plate tribometer. Surface sensitive analytical techniques, such as energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been used for tribofilm characterisation. The XPS peaks have been deconvoluted to characterise the species formed in the wear scar. The formation of species with different tribological properties, due to the decomposition of ZDDP and MoDTC molecules as a result of testing temperature, is shown. Surface analyses have shown that MoDTC decomposes, even in low-lubricant bulk temperature tests (30 ??C), forming the same species as in high-lubricant bulk temperature tests (100 and 150 ??C) but the tribofilms give different tribological performance. The effectiveness in friction reduction is shown to depend on the ratio between what are defined as high- and low-friction species in the tribofilm. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper we report molecular dynamics simulation results of lubricant films only a few nanometres thick confined between atomically smooth gold or model mica surfaces. We have studied dodecane (C12H26) of various film thicknesses. We show below a critical film thickness structural transitions take place with the formation of crystal bridges. We demonstrate this critical film thickness is larger with Au(1 0 0) surface. Below this critical film thickness we observe a large enhancement of apparent shear viscosity. This enhancement, however, is much lower for films confined by gold. We find the extrapolated zero shear viscosity of a ∼2.4-nm-thick film confined by gold is almost two orders of magnitude lower than that of a film, of the same thickness, confined by model mica. We find the source of this difference is the weaker pinning of the layers next to the surface of the gold. This leads to stronger slip, at the lubricantgold interface, which persists at solid-like and liquid-like states. For mica a larger part of shearing takes place inside the film. The solid-like structure of the films confined by gold shows stronger resilience to shear and melt at considerably larger shear rates than those confined by model mica surfaces. These differences could be important in developing low friction devices at microscale. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Results show that mechanical and thermal slips are reduced by increasing the surface energy.

abstract = {White structure flaking (WSF) as a premature wear failure mode in steel rolling element bearings is caused by white etching cracks (WECs) formed in the 1. mm zone beneath the contact surface. Hydrogen release and diffusion into the bearing steel during operation and transient operating conditions have been suggested as drivers of WSF. The presence of diffusible hydrogen in steel under rolling contact fatigue (RCF) has been shown to strongly promote the formation of WEA/WECs. However, the initiation and propagation mechanisms, as well as the thresholds for WEC formation, are not well understood. This study uses hydrogen charging of 100Cr6 bearing steel rollers prior to testing on a two-roller RCF rig to enable WEA/WEC formation under service realistic loading. This study focuses on the influence of the concentration of diffusible hydrogen, the magnitude of the contact load and the number of rolling cycles on the formation of white etching features (butterflies, WEA/WECs) which are determined by a serial sectioning process. The formation of butterflies was found to be independent of concentration of diffusible hydrogen with the test parameters used, but dependent on contact pressure and number of rolling cycles up to a threshold. WEA/WEC formation thresholds were found at certain values of the concentration of diffusible hydrogen, contact pressure and number of rolling cycles. The results also show evidence for a subsurface initiation mechanism of WECs from non-metallic inclusions. It is proposed that one mechanism of WEC formation is due to multiple linking of extended butterflies or small WECs in the subsurface to form larger WEC networks that eventually propagate to the surface resulting in WSF. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Problems in the petrochemical industry ranging from product blending, refinery unit optimization, and unit design to multiplant production, and distribution planning are discussed. The nonlinear networks topic includes electric power dispatch, hydroelectric reservoir management, and problems involving traffic flow in urban transportation networks. In economic planning, we describe NLP applications involving large dynamic econometric models, a variety of static equilibrium models, and submodels of larger planning systems. In each area we consider the problem and its nonlinear model, the various algorithms and software systems which have been applied, and (where available) the benefits derived. Some obstacles are identified which currently inhibit the effective use of nonlinear optimization models, and research aimed at overcoming these obstacles is suggested.

abstract = {Premature wind turbine gearbox bearing failures in the form of white structure flaking (WSF) can occur in as little as 6-24 months of operation. WSF is not fully understood but is thought to be due to hydrogen release and diffusion into the bearing steel and/or transient operating conditions not fully understood. The initiation mechanisms of white etching cracks (WECs) are contested, where amongst others mechanisms, subsurface initiation at non-metallic inclusions (perhaps associated with extension of butterfly cracks) and surface crack initiation are cited. For the first time this study applies serial sectioning to map WEC networks in wind turbine gearbox bearings to elucidate WEC initiation mechanisms. A comparison is made between WEC data for inner rings of an industrial transient test gearbox bearing and a planet bearing that spalled in service. It is proposed that one mechanism of WEC formation in wind turbine gearbox bearings is due to subsurface WEC initiation from inclusions, either in a butterfly manner or non-butterfly manner; where these small WECs link together to form larger WEC networks, these eventually propagating to the surface resulting in WSF. Small size/length inclusions were found to be likely WEC initiators, therefore the data suggests that steel cleanliness standards analysing inclusion density (as opposed to maximum inclusion lengths) are more relevant in understanding butterfly/WEC initiation in wind turbine gearbox bearings. However standards used should be able to differentiate pure sulfides from sulfides+oxide encapsulations and record inclusions that are only a couple of mircometer's in length/diameter. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the strengthening mechanisms associated with the various components of martensitic microstructures in steels and other ferrous alloys. The first section examines the experiments and strengthening theories associated with Fe–Ni and Fe–Ni–C alloys, in which the martensite, because of subzero Ms temperatures, can be evaluated with carbon atoms trapped in octahedral interstitial sites. The evaluation of strengthening in these alloys has been limited to interpreting yield strength of unaged, untempered martensite in terms of interstitial solid solution strengthening. The second section reviews strengthening of martensitic Fe–C alloys and low-alloy carbon steels with above-room-temperature Ms temperatures. In these alloys, it is impossible to prevent C diffusion during quenching, and strengthening of martensite becomes dependent on static and dynamic strain aging due to carbon atom interaction with dislocation substructure. In all alloys the dominant strengthening component of martensitic microstructures is the matrix of martensitic crystals, either in lath or plate morphology, but secondary effects due to other microstructural components such as carbides and retained austenite are also discussed.},

abstract = {We study the effect of strain on the lithium diffusion barrier in diamond cubic Si using nudged-elastic band (NEB) method. The modified embedded atom method (MEAM) interatomic potential is employed to describe the interactions between Li and Si atoms. The activation barrier and minimum energy path is found to change significantly as the biaxial strain changes from compressive to tensile in nature. The local strain arising from the presence of neighboring Li atoms is found to affect the activation barrier even more. The Si-Si bond stretching and breaking events during Li diffusion are investigated to elucidate the change in barrier with changing local environment and strain. This study highlights that bulk strain as well as local strain arising from the presence of Li atoms in the vicinity of a diffusing Li atom can affect the Li diffusion constant by orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {A method is presented for the study of rare events such as conformational changes arising in activated processes whose reaction coordinate is not known beforehand and for which the assumptions of transition state theory are invalid. The method samples the energy landscape adaptively and determines the isoprobability surfaces for the transition: by definition the trajectories initiated anywhere on one of these surfaces has equal probability to reach first one metastable set rather than the other. Upon weighting these surfaces by the equilibrium probability distribution, one obtains an effective transition pathway, i.e., a tube in configuration space inside which conformational changes occur with high probability, and the associated rate. The method is first validated on a simple two-dimensional example; then it is applied to a model of solid-solid transformation of a condensed system.},

abstract = {The parametrization and testing of the OPLS all-atom force field for organic molecules and peptides are described. Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2{\%} for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

Each section of the review focuses on an individual condition or parameter that affects atomic friction including materials, surfaces, compliance, contact area, normal load, temperature, and velocity. The role each parameter plays is described in the context of both experimental measurements and simulation predictions. In addition, the discussion includes an overview of the research community's current understanding of observed effects, guidelines for implementation of those effects in an atomistic simulation, and suggestions for future research to address open questions. Taken together, this review conveys the message that friction at the atomic scale is affected by many interrelated parameters and that the use of molecular dynamics simulation as a predictive tool can be accomplished only through careful model design.},

abstract = {As current experimental and simulation methods cannot determine the mobility of flat boundaries across the large misorientation phase space, we have developed a computational method for imposing an artificial driving force on boundaries. In a molecular dynamics simulation, this allows us to go beyond the inherent timescale restrictions of the technique and induce non-negligible motion in flat boundaries of arbitrary misorientation. For different series of symmetric boundaries, we find both expected and unexpected results. In general, mobility increases as the grain boundary plane deviates from (111), but high-coincidence and low-angle boundaries represent special cases. These results agree with and enrich experimental observations.},

@article{Pedersen2009a,
abstract = {Long-timescale simulations of hydrogen atom diffusion in aluminum at low concentration were carried out to study the effect grain boundaries can have on the diffusion mechanism and diffusion rate. Three different grain boundaries were studied: $\Sigma$ 5 twist, $\Sigma$ 5 tilt and general, twist + tilt, grain boundaries. The adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the system over time intervals spanning tens of microseconds. A potential function of the effective medium form was parametrized to density functional theory calculations and used to describe the atomic interactions. The twist boundary turns out to block diffusion across the boundary - only a few high-energy sites are found in the boundary layer. However, diffusion parallel to the boundary is slightly enhanced because of the reduced configuration space. The twist and twist + tilt grain boundaries have strong binding sites within the boundary layer, up to 0.1 and 0.3 eV stronger, respectively, than binding sites in the crystal. In the latter case, the H atom spends more than 99{\%} of the time in the grain boundary layer and diffusion parallel to the grain boundary occurs only when the H atom re-enters a crystal grain. Because of the trapping, the diffusion is reduced by more than an order of magnitude compared with the crystal. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {In the present study, grain boundary (GB) mobility was determined by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two different techniques: the applied strain method and the adapted interface random walk method. The first method involves a driving force while the second method does not. Nevertheless, both methods led to essentially the same values of the GB mobility. This shows that the GB mobility is independent of the nature of the driving force, provided that it is low enough that the linear velocity–driving force relationship is properly sampled. The case studied here can be viewed as a validated reference case that can be used in future studies to test new techniques to determine the GB mobility. For this purpose we provide the full information about the interatomic potential we employed and the initial atomic configurations. Finally, we use the obtained results to discuss whether any existing MD simulation data agree with experimental data on pure metals.},

abstract = {Ball and rolling element bearings are perhaps the most widely used components in industrial machinery. They are used to support load and allow relative motion inherent in the mechanism to take place. Subsurface originated spalling has been recognized as one of the main modes of failure for rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of bearings. In the past few decades a significant number of investigators have attempted to determine the physical mechanisms involved in rolling contact fatigue of bearings and proposed models to predict their fatigue lives. In this paper, some of the most widely used RCF models are reviewed and discussed, and their limitations are addressed. The paper also presents the modeling approaches recently proposed by the authors to develop life models and better understanding of the RCF.},

abstract = {Modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) interatomic potentials for the Fe-Ti-C and Fe-Ti-N ternary systems have been developed based on the previously developed MEAM potentials for sub-unary and binary systems. An attempt was made to find a way to determine ternary potential parameters using the corresponding binary parameters. The calculated coherent interface properties, interfacial energy, work of separation and misfit strain energy between body-centered cubic Fe and NaCl-type TiC or TiN were reasonable when compared with relevant first-principles calculations under the same condition. The applicability of the present potentials for atomistic simulations to investigate nucleation kinetics of TiC or TiN precipitates and their effects on mechanical properties in steels is also demonstrated. {\textcopyright} 2009 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations of interphase boundary energies relevant to hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) $\gamma$-precipitate formation were performed within approximate unit cells that mirror the experimental conditions in face-centered-cubic (fcc) Al-Ag solid solutions. In Al-rich, fcc Al-Ag, $\gamma$ precipitates are observed to form rapidly with large (300+) aspect ratios even though the Al stacking-fault energy is high (approximately 130 mJ/m2), which should suppress hcp ribbon formation according to standard arguments. Our DFT results show why high-aspect ratio plates occur and why previous estimates based on Wulff construction were orders of magnitude less than observed values. Using DFT, we obtain a Gibbs free-energy diagram that gives the relevant hcp equilibrium precipitate structure occurring at 50 at. {\%} Ag. We derive the critical nucleation parameters for $\gamma$-precipitate formation, which require our calculated bulk-driving force for nucleation and interphase boundary energies. From our DFT-based nonequilibrium estimate for precipitation that accounts for growth via coarsening by ledge and edge migrations, we obtain time-dependent aspect ratio that agrees well with experiment. The same energetics and growth model are relevant to other phenomena, such as lath morphology in martensites or island coarsening.},

abstract = {The structural and elastic properties of MgO periclase were studied up to 150 GPa with the first-principles pseudopotential method within the local density approximation. The calculated lattice constant of the B1 phase over the pressure range studied is within 1{\%} of experimental values. The observed B1 phase of MgO was found to be stable up to 450 GPa, precluding the B1-B2 phase transition within the lower mantle. The calculated transition pressure is less than one-half of the previous pseudopotential prediction but is very close to the linearized augmented plane-wave result. All three independent elastic constants, c(11), c(12), and c(44) for the B1 phase are calculated from direct computation of stresses generated by small strains. The calculated zero-pressure values of the elastic moduli and wave velocities and their initial pressure dependence are in excellent agreement with experiments. MgO was found to be highly anisotropic in its elastic properties, with the magnitude of the anisotropy first decreasing between 0 and 15 Gpa and then increasing from 15 to 150 GPa. Longitudinal and shear-wave velocities were found to vary by 23 and 59{\%}, respectively, with propagation direction at 150 Gpa. The character of the anisotropy changes qualitatively with pressure. At zero pressure longitudinal and shear-wave propagations are fastest along [111] and [100], respectively, whereas above 15 GPa, the corresponding fast directions are [100] and [110]. The Cauchy condition was found to be strongly violated in MgO, reflecting the importance of noncentral many-body forces.},

@article{Potirniche2006,
abstract = {Fatigue damage in face-centred cubic crystals by dislocation substructuring and crack growth was computationally simulated at the atomic scale. Single-crystal copper specimens with approximately 200 000 atoms and an initial crack were subjected to fatigue loading with a constant strain amplitude of epsilon(max) = 0.01 and a load ratio of R = epsilon(min)/epsilon(max) = 0.75. Cyclic plastic deformation around the crack tip is the main influencing factor for the propagation mechanisms of nanocracks. The main crack-propagation mechanisms occurred either by void nucleation in the high-density region near the crack tip or by fatigue cleavage of the atomic bonds in the crack plane. Fatigue crack growth at grain boundaries was also studied. For high misorientation angle grain boundaries, the crack path deviated while moving from one grain to another. For low crystal misorientations, the crack did not experience any significant out-of-plane deviation. For a large crystal misorientation, voids were observed to nucleate at grain boundaries in front of the crack tip and link back with the main crack. During fatigue loading, dislocation substructures were observed to develop throughout the atomic lattices. Fatigue crack growth rates for nanocracks were computed and compared with growth rates published in the literature for microstructurally small cracks ( micron range) and long cracks ( millimetre range). The computed growth rates for nanocracks were comparable with those for small cracks at the same stress intensity ranges and they propagated below the threshold for long cracks.},

abstract = {Atomistic simulations, confirmed by electron microscopy, show that dislocations in aluminum can have compact or dissociated cores. The calculated minimum stress (sigma(P)) required to move an edge dislocation is approximately 20 times smaller for dissociated than for equivalent compact dislocations. This contradicts the well accepted generalized stacking fault energy paradigm that predicts similar sigma(P) values for both configurations. Additionally, Frank's rule and the Schmid law are also violated because dislocation core energies become important. These results may help settle a 50-year-old puzzle regarding the magnitude of sigma(P) in face-centered-cubic metals, and provide new insights into the deformation of ultra-fine-grained metals.},

Here we propose a modification of this method in which the complex bond order vectors are averaged over the first neighbor shell of a given particle and the particle itself. As demonstrated using soft particle systems, this averaging procedure considerably improves the accuracy with which different crystal structures can be distinguished.},

abstract = {Atomistic calculations for the 112-generalized stacking fault (GSF) energy curve are performed for various embedded atom models of FCC metals. Models include those by Voter and Chen: Angelo, Moody and Baskes; Oh and Johnson; Mishin and Farkas; and Ercolessi and Adams. The resulting curves show similar characteristics but vary in their agreement with the experimental estimates of the intrinsic stacking fault energy, gamma(sf), and with density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the GSF curve. These curves are used to obtain estimates of the unstable stacking fault energy, gamma(us), a quantity used in a criterion for dislocation nucleation. Curves For nickel and copper models show the theoretically expected skewed sinusoidal shape; however, several of the aluminium models produce an irregularly shaped GSF curve. Copper and aluminium values for gamma(us) are underestimates of calculations from DFT, although some of the nickel models produce a value matching one of the available DFT results. Values for gamma(sf) are either fitted to, or underestimate, the measured results. For use in simulations, the authors recommend using the Voter and Chen potential for copper, and either the Angelo, Moody and Baskes potential or the Voter and Chen potential for nickel. None of the potentials model aluminium well, indicating the need for a more-advanced empirical potential.},

abstract = {The search for deformation mechanisms in nanocrystalline metals has profited from the use of molecular dynamics calculations. These simulations have revealed two possible mechanisms; grain boundary accommodation, and intragranular slip involving dislocation emission and absorption at grain boundaries. But the precise nature of the slip mechanism is the subject of considerable debate, and the limitations of the simulation technique need to be taken into consideration. Here we show, using molecular dynamics simulations, that the nature of slip in nanocrystalline metals cannot be described in terms of the absolute value of the stacking fault energy-a correct interpretation requires the generalized stacking fault energy curve, involving both stable and unstable stacking fault energies. The molecular dynamics technique does not at present allow for the determination of rate-limiting processes, so the use of our calculations in the interpretation of experiments has to be undertaken with care.},

abstract = {The spontaneous capillary imbibition and drainage processes are studied using many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) simulations. By adjusting the solid-liquid interaction parameter, different wetting behavior between the fluid and the capillary wall, corresponding to the static contact angle ranging from 0 degrees to 180 degrees, can be controllably simulated. For wetting fluids, the spontaneous capillary imbibition (SCI) is evident in MDPD simulations. It is found that, whereas the corrected Lucas-Washburn equation (taking into account the dynamic contact angle and the fluid inertia) can well describe the SCI simulation result for the completely wetting fluid, it deviates, to a notable degree, from the results of partly wetting fluids. In particular, this corrected equation cannot be used to describe the spontaneous capillary drainage (SCD) processes. To solve this problem, we derive an improved form of the Lucas-Washburn equation, in which the slip effects of fluid particles at the capillary wall are treated. Such an improved equation turns out to be capable of describing all the simulation results of both the SCI and the SCD. These findings provide new insights into the SCI and SCD processes and improve the mathematical base.},

Sensitivity analysis can help in identifying critical control points, prioritizing additional data collection or research, and verifying and validating a model. Ten sensitivity analysis methods, including four mathematical methods, five statistical methods, and one graphical method, are identified. The selected methods are compared on the basis of their applicability to different types of models, computational issues such as initial data requirement and complexity of their application, representation of the sensitivity, and the specific uses of these methods. Applications of these methods are illustrated with examples from various fields. No one method is clearly best for food-safety risk models. In general, use of two or more methods, preferably with dissimilar theoretical foundations, may be needed to increase confidence in the ranking of key inputs.},

@article{Wolf2005,
abstract = {We review the results of recent molecular-dynamics simulations of the structure and deformation behavior of nanocrystalline materials, i.e., polycrystalline materials with a grain size of typically less than about 100 nm. These simulations have now become large enough and sophisticated enough that they are beginning to cover the entire range of grain sizes over which the experimentally suggested transition from a dislocation-based deformation mechanism to one involving GB processes takes place. Their atomic-level resolution provides novel insights into the intricate interplay between the dislocation and GB processes responsible for this crossover. These simulations also reveal how and why this crossover in the dominant mechanism leads to a transition in the mechanical behavior. However, in spite of these early successes, these simulations are inherently limited to rather idealized model microstructures and extremely high deformation rates. We therefore address the critical question as to the degree to which they begin to capture the experimentally observed, albeit controversial, deformation behavior of real nanocrystalline materials.

@article{Sun1993,
abstract = {The normal stress distribution across a slip plane has the effect of reducing the critical loading required for dislocation emission from a crack tip. The reduction by normal stresses was found to be very significant for Si, based on properties estimated for it using density functional theory, to be large for Fe as modeled by the embedded atom method (EAM), and to be smaller in Al, Ni and ordered Ni3Al, estimated using the EAM. The general dependence over a wide range on parameters characterizing the tension-shear coupling was also determined. In the context of a Peierls model for dislocation nucleation at a crack tip (J.R. Rice, J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 40 (1992) 239), our approach was to search for onset of the dislocation nucleation instability based on the numerical solution of the system of non-linear integral equations describing an incipient dislocation. The incipient dislocation consists of a distribution of sliding and opening displacements along a slip plane emanating from the crack tip; these displacements are related to the shear and tensile stresses across the slip plane by constitutive relations based on the atomic models mentioned. Results from the atomic models are used to parametrize constitutive relations involving a Frenkel sinusoidal dependence of shear stress on sliding displacement at any fixed opening displacement, and a Rose-Ferrante-Smith universal binding form of dependence of tensile stress on opening displacement at any fixed shear displacement. These relations then enter the system of integral equations, solved numerically, which describe the elasticity solution for a non-uniform distribution of sliding and opening along the slip plane. The results show that tension-shear coupling will often significantly reduce the loading for dislocation emission from the value estimated on the basis of an unstable stacking energy $\gamma$us determined with neglect of such coupling, in a shear-only type analysis. For the EAM models of the metals considered, a simple and approximate method to account for the tension effects is to use a modified quantity $\gamma$us(u∗), which is an unstable stacking energy for lattice planes which are constrained to a fixed opening $\Delta$$\theta$∗, corresponding to that for vinishing normal stress at the unstable shear equilibrium position. Moreover, it is found that the normal stress effect can be described well in these cases by replacing the unstable stacking energy $\gamma$us in the shear-only model by a tension softened $\gamma$us($\Psi$), which depends on the phase angle $\Psi$ of the combined tension-shear loading along the slip plane according to the stress intensity factors of the elastic singular solution. The same simple procedures for accounting for tension effects on nucleation are less suitable for lattices with strong coupling such as Si.},

@article{Sheppard2008,
abstract = {A comparison of chain-of-states based methods for finding minimum energy pathways (MEPs) is presented. In each method, a set of images along an initial pathway between two local minima is relaxed to find a MEP. We compare the nudged elastic band (NEB), doubly nudged elastic band, string, and simplified string methods, each with a set of commonly used optimizers. Our results show that the NEB and string methods are essentially equivalent and the most efficient methods for finding MEPs when coupled with a suitable optimizer. The most efficient optimizer was found to be a form of the limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno method in which the approximate inverse Hessian is constructed globally for all images along the path. The use of a climbing-image allows for finding the saddle point while representing the MEP with as few images as possible. If a highly accurate MEP is desired, it is found to be more efficient to descend from the saddle to the minima than to use a chain-of-states method with many images. Our results are based on a pairwise Morse potential to model rearrangements of a heptamer island on Pt(111), and plane-wave based density functional theory to model a rollover diffusion mechanism of a Pd tetramer on MgO(100) and dissociative adsorption and diffusion of oxygen on Au(111).},

Mixed (Ti,V) nitrides were found in all the structures, but there was no evidence for mixed carbonitride formation. The Hillert-Staffansson model was used to predict the composition of the nitrides as a function of tem-perature. Upon prolonged aging many of the precipitates became “fragmented” and were no longer single crystals. At the same time, the volume fraction of precipitates dropped, while their average Ti content increased. Possible explanations for this unexpected behavior are discussed in this article.},

abstract = {We employ density functional theory to investigate and compare Al/TiC and Al/TiN interfaces by electronic structures, relaxed atomic geometries and adhesions. The results show that the preferred bonding site is the interfacial Al atoms above the ceramic's metalloid atoms for both systems. The calculated adhesion energies are quantitatively in agreement with other calculated and experimental results of Al on the carbide and nitride. A detailed comparison of the adhesion energies and relaxed structures shows weaker bonding and less relaxation in the Al/nitride case, which is correlated with the lower surface energy of the ceramic. We have thoroughly characterized the electronic structure and determined that the polar covalent Al3sp–C(N)2s bonds constitute the primary interfacial bonding interaction. The larger overlapping bonding states at the Al/TiC interface reveal the reason why it exhibits relatively larger adhesion energy. Cleavage may take place preferentially at the interface, especially for the Al/TiN, which is in agreement with experimental results.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) seek to improve upon the accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3–4 {\%} is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

@article{Kushima2011,
abstract = {We report on the mechanism and energy barrier for oxygen diffusion in tetragonal La(2)CoO(4+$\delta$). The first principles-based calculations in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) formalism were performed to precisely describe the dominant migration paths for the interstitial oxygen atom in La(2)CoO(4+$\delta$). Atomistic simulations using molecular dynamics (MD) were performed to quantify the temperature dependent collective diffusivity, and to enable a comparison of the diffusion barriers found from the force field-based simulations to those obtained from the first principles-based calculations. Both techniques consistently predict that oxygen migrates dominantly via an interstitialcy mechanism. The single interstitialcy migration path involves the removal of an apical lattice oxygen atom out from the LaO-plane and placing it into the nearest available interstitial site, whilst the original interstitial replaces the displaced apical oxygen on the LaO-plane. The facile migration of the interstitial oxygen in this path is enabled by the cooperative titling-untilting of the CoO(6) octahedron. DFT calculations indicate that this process has an activation energy significantly lower than that of the direct interstitial site exchange mechanism. For 800-1000 K, the MD diffusivities are consistent with the available experimental data within one order of magnitude. The DFT- and the MD-predictions suggest that the diffusion barrier for the interstitialcy mechanism is within 0.31-0.80 eV. The identified migration path, activation energies and diffusivities, and the associated uncertainties are discussed in the context of the previous experimental and theoretical results from the related Ruddlesden-Popper structures.},

abstract = {We investigate the application of embedded atom method (EAM) interatomic potentials in the study of crystallization kinetics from deeply undercooled melts, focusing on the fcc metals Al and Cu. For this application, it is important that the EAM potential accurately reproduces melting properties and liquid structure, in addition to the crystalline properties most commonly fit in its development. To test the accuracy of previously published EAM potentials and to guide the development of new potential in this work, first-principles calculations have been performed and new experimental measurements of the Al and Cu liquid structure factors have been undertaken by X-ray diffraction. We demonstrate that the previously published EAM potentials predict a liquid structure that is too strongly ordered relative to measured diffraction data. We develop new EAM potentials for Al and Cu to improve the agreement with the first-principles and measured liquid diffraction data. Furthermore, we calculate liquid-phase diffusivities and find that this quantity correlates well with the liquid structure. Finally, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of crystal nucleation from the melt during quenching at constant cooling rate. We find that EAM potentials, which predict the same zero-temperature crystal properties but different liquid structures, can lead to quite different crystallization kinetics. More interestingly, we find that two potentials predicting very similar equilibrium solid and liquid properties can still produce very different crystallization kinetics under far-from-equilibrium conditions characteristic of the rapid quenching simulations employed here.},

abstract = {In this work, we developed an interatomic potential for saturated hydrocarbons using the modified embedded-atom method (MEAM), a reactive semi-empirical many-body potential based on density functional theory and pair potentials. We parameterized the potential by fitting to a large experimental and first-principles (FP) database consisting of (1) bond distances, bond angles, and atomization energies at 0 K of a homologous series of alkanes and their select isomers from methane to n-octane, (2) the potential energy curves of H2, CH, and C2 diatomics, (3) the potential energy curves of hydrogen, methane, ethane, and propane dimers, i.e., (H2)2, (CH4)2, (C2H6)2, and (C3H8)2, respectively, and (4) pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) data of a dense high-pressure methane system with the density of 0.5534 g cc(-1). We compared the atomization energies and geometries of a range of linear alkanes, cycloalkanes, and free radicals calculated from the MEAM potential to those calculated by other commonly used reactive potentials for hydrocarbons, i.e., second-generation reactive empirical bond order (REBO) and reactive force field (ReaxFF). MEAM reproduced the experimental and/or FP data with accuracy comparable to or better than REBO or ReaxFF. The experimental PVT data for a relatively large series of methane, ethane, propane, and butane systems with different densities were predicted reasonably well by the MEAM potential. Although the MEAM formalism has been applied to atomic systems with predominantly metallic bonding in the past, the current work demonstrates the promising extension of the MEAM potential to covalently bonded molecular systems, specifically saturated hydrocarbons and saturated hydrocarbon-based polymers. The MEAM potential has already been parameterized for a large number of metallic unary, binary, ternary, carbide, nitride, and hydride systems, and extending it to saturated hydrocarbons provides a reliable and transferable potential for atomistic/molecular studies of complex material phenomena involving hydrocarbon-metal or polymer-metal interfaces, polymer-metal nanocomposites, fracture and failure in hydrocarbon-based polymers, etc. The latter is especially true since MEAM is a reactive potential that allows for dynamic bond formation and bond breaking during simulation. Our results show that MEAM predicts the energetics of two major chemical reactions for saturated hydrocarbons, i.e., breaking a C-C and a C-H bond, reasonably well. However, the current parameterization does not accurately reproduce the energetics and structures of unsaturated hydrocarbons and, therefore, should not be applied to such systems.},

These and other developments substantially improve the efficiency of the algorithm and allow reliable prediction of structures with up to ???200 atoms in the unit cell. We show that an advanced version of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can be created on the basis of our method, but PSO is strongly outperformed by USPEX. We also show how ideas from metadynamics can be used in the context of evolutionary structure prediction for escaping from local minima. Our cluster structure prediction algorithm, using the ideas initially developed for crystals, also shows excellent performance and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A novel non-equilibrium method for calculating transport coefficients is presented. It reverses the experimental cause-and-effect picture, e.g. for the calculation of viscosities: the effect, the momentum flux or stress, is imposed, whereas the cause, the velocity gradient or shear rates, is obtained from the simulation. It differs from other Norton-ensemble methods by the way, in which the steady-state fluxes are maintained. This method involves a simple exchange of particle momenta, which is easy to implement and to analyse. Moreover, it can be made to conserve the total energy as well as the total linear momentum, so no thermostatting is needed. The resulting raw data are robust and rapidly converging. The method is tested on the calculation of the shear viscosity, the thermal conductivity and the Soret coefficient (thermal diffusion) for the Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid near its triple point. Possible applications to other transport coefficients and more complicated systems are discussed.},

Biodegradability of base oils and lubricants have been determined by a large number of test methods. Among these, the 21 day test developed by Coordinating European Council and designated as CEC-L-33-A-93 has been accepted worldwide. In this work, artificial neural network (ANN) technique has been used to construct mathematical models for predicting biodegradability of base oils based upon their chemical composition, viscosity and viscosity index. The chemical composition has been determined either by NMR or mass spectrometry and two models have been developed. Thirty-one base oils of different origin and processing schemes, and their blends with polyalphaolefin (PAO) were analyzed for chemical composition and biodegradability. Part of the data was used for developing the models using backpropagation ANN, while the remaining data were used for evaluating the predictive ability of the models (correlation coefficient, R 2∼0.97). The models can serve as useful tools for screening base oils before subjecting them to 21 day biodegradability test.},

abstract = {In this work, we examine the kink-nucleation process in BCC screw dislocations using atomistic simulation and transition pathway analysis, with a particular focus on the compact core structure. We observe the existence of a threshold stress, which results in an abrupt change in the minimum energy path of the kink-nucleation process, and hence, a discontinuity in the activation energy versus stress for the process. The magnitude of the discontinuity is found to be related to the degree of metastability of an intermediate split-core structure. This feature appears to be a direct consequence of the so-called 'camel-hump' nature of the Peierls potential, which manifests itself in the existence of a metastable, intermediate split-core structure. The effect is observed in a number of empirical EAM potentials, including Fe, Ta, V, Nb and Mo, suggesting a generality to the observations.},

abstract = {Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations of confined model liquids under pressure and sheared by the relative sliding of the boundary walls have been carried out. The relationship between the time-dependent traction coefficient, mu(t), and the state of internal structure of the film is followed from commencement of shear for various control parameters, such as applied load, global shear rate, and solid-liquid atom interaction parameters. Phase diagrams, velocity and temperature profiles, and traction coefficient diagrams are analyzed for pure Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquids and a binary LJ mixture. A single component LJ liquid is found to form semicrystalline arrangements with high-traction coefficients, and stick-slip behavior is observed for high pressures and low-shear velocities, which is shown to involve periodic deformation and stress release of the wall atoms and slip in the solid-liquid boundary region. A binary mixture, which discourages crystallization, gives a more classical tribological response with the larger atoms preferentially adsorbing commensurate with the wall. The results obtained are analyzed in the context of tribology: the binary mixture behaves like a typical lubricant, whereas the monatomic system behaves like a traction fluid. It is discussed how this type of simulation can give insights on the tribological behavior of realistic systems.},

abstract = {Methods based on first-principles calculations have proven effective for predicting the thermodynamic stability of materials that have not previously been considered. However, the vast majority of these predictions are based on 0 K calculations, which means that little is known about the effects of temperature on their accuracy. This causes considerable uncertainty with respect to stability predictions of new hypothetical phases. In this work we combine first-principles calculations with an optimization procedure to calculate the phase stability as a function of temperature for Ti2AlC, Ti 3AlC2 and Ti4AlC3 MAX phases with respect to their most competing phases in the Ti-Al-C phase diagram, in a temperature interval from 0 to 2000 K. To model nonzero temperatures, we include effects from the electronic and vibrational free energies to the Gibbs free energy for all relevant competing phases. We show that, due to a mutual cancellation of the temperature dependent energy terms, the results of neither the harmonic nor the quasiharmonic calculations differ significantly from the calculated 0 K formation energies. We thus provide a plausible explanation for the success of previous 0 K predictions, an explanation which also serves as evidence for the hypothesis that the phase stability in many materials systems is primarily governed by the 0 K energy terms. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The densest amorphous packing of rigid particles is known as random close packing. It has long been appreciated that higher densities are achieved by using collections of particles with a variety of sizes. The variety of sizes is often quantified by the polydispersity of the particle size distribution: the standard deviation of the radius divided by the mean radius. Several prior studies quantified the increase of the packing density as a function of polydispersity. Of course, a particle size distribution is also characterized by its skewness, kurtosis, and higher moments, but the influence of these parameters has not been carefully quantified before. In this work, we numerically generate many packings with different particle radii distributions, varying polydispersity and skewness independently of one another. We find two significant results. First, the skewness can have a significant effect on the packing density and in some cases can have a larger effect than polydispersity. Second, the packing fraction is relatively insensitive to the value of the kurtosis. We present a simple empirical formula for the value of the random close packing density as a function of polydispersity and skewness.},

abstract = {Energy is commonly dissipated in molecular dynamics simulations by using a thermostat. In non-isothermal shear simulations of confined liquids, the choice of the thermostat is very delicate. We show in this paper that under certain conditions, the use of classical thermostats can lead to an erroneous description of the dynamics in the confined system. This occurs when a critical shear rate is surpassed as the thermo-viscous effects become prominent. In this high-shear-high-dissipation regime, advanced dissipation methods including a novel one are introduced and compared. The MD results show that the physical modeling of both the accommodation of the surface temperature to liquid heating and the heat conduction through the confining solids is essential. The novel method offers several advantages on existing ones including computational efficiency and easiness of application for complex systems.},

The method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints.

This expression is used to analyze the deformation fields for a one-dimensional atomic chain, a biaxially stretched thin film containing a surface ledge, and a FCC metal subject to indentation loading from a nanometer-scale indenter. The analyses presented show that the metric established here is consistent with the continuum mechanical concept of deformation gradient (which is known to have a zero curl for compatible deformations) in most instances. However, our metric does yield non-zero values of curl for atoms near loaded geometric inhomogeneities, such as those that form the ledges themselves and those beneath or adjacent to the indentation contact region. Also, we present expressions for higher order gradients of the deformation field and discuss the requirements for their calculation. These expressions are necessary for linking atomistic simulation results with advanced continuum mechanics theories such as strain gradient plasticity, thereby enabling fundamental, atomic-scale information to contribute to the formulation and parameterization of such theories. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {For the successful development and application of lubricants, a full understanding of the nanoscale behavior of complex tribological systems is required, but this is difficult to obtain experimentally. In this study, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations to examine the atomistic structure and friction properties of commercially relevant organic friction modifier (OFM) monolayers adsorbed on iron oxide surfaces and lubricated by a thin, separating layer of hexadecane. Specifically, acid, amide, and glyceride OFMs, with saturated and Z-unsaturated hydrocarbon tail groups, are simulated at various surface coverages and sliding velocities. At low and medium coverage, the OFMs form liquidlike and amorphous monolayers, respectively, which are significantly interdigitated with the hexadecane lubricant, resulting in relatively high friction coefficients. At high coverage, solidlike monolayers are formed for all of the OFMs, which, during sliding, results in slip planes between well-defined OFM and hexadecane layers, yielding a marked reduction in the friction coefficient. When present at equal surface coverage, OFMs with saturated and Z-unsaturated tail groups are found to yield similar structure and friction behavior. OFMs with glyceride head groups yield significantly lower friction coefficients than amide and particularly carboxylic acid head groups. For all of the OFMs and coverages simulated, the friction coefficient is found to increase linearly with the logarithm of sliding velocity; however, the gradient of this increase depends on the coverage. The structure and friction details obtained from these simulations agree well with experimental results and also shed light on the relative tribological performance of these OFMs through nanoscale structural variations. This has important implications in terms of the applicability of NEMD to aid the development of new formulations to control friction.},

abstract = {The tensile stress at break (?b) and the associated ultimate strain ({\&}epsi;b) of an elastomer depend on (1) the chemical and topological characteristics of the polymeric network, and (2) the test conditions under which rupture is observed. To separate these effects, the ultimate tensile properties can often be characterized by a ?failure envelope? defined by values of ?b and {\&}epsi;b determined at various strain rates over a wide temperature range. Provided time - temperature superposition is applicable, such data superpose on a plot of log ?bT{\&}epsi;/T versus log {\&}epsi;b, where T is the test temperature (absolute) and T0 is an arbitrarily selected reference temperature. The resulting failure envelope is independent of time (strain rate) and temperature and thus it depends only on basic characteristics of the polymeric network. To illustrate the characterization method, data on two styrene - butadiene gum vulcanizates, SBR-I and SBR-II, were analyzed. For SBR-I, values of ?b and {\&}epsi;b obtained over extensive ranges of strain rate and temperature superposed to give a failure envelope. Data at elevated temperatures also gave a reliable value for the equilibrium modulus. For SBR-II, data obtained at various temperatures under conditions of constant strain and constant strain rate yielded identical failure envelopes; this strongly suggests that the failure envelope is independent of the test method. A theoretical consideration of the time-to-rupture associated with different test methods showed that for given values of ?b and {\&}epsi;b the time-to-rupture from the following types of tests should increase in the order: constant strain {\textless} constant stress {\textless} constant strain rate {\textless} constant stress rate.},

The as-derived potential-energy surfaces were shifted and scaled to match experimental reference data. In constructing the PES, a variety of properties of the elements were considered, including lattice dynamics,mechanical properties, thermal behavior, energetics of competing crystal structures, defects, deformation paths, liquid structures, and so forth. For each element, the constructed EAM potentials were tested against the experiment data pertaining to thermal expansion, melting, and liquid dynamics via molecular dynamics computer simulation. The as-developed potentials demonstrate high fidelity and robustness. Owing to their improved accuracy and wide applicability, the potentials are suitable for high-quality atomistic computer simulation of practical applications.},

This mechanism relies on the generation of crystal defects known as disclinations by migrating grain boundaries. Crack healing by disclinations does not require any compressive loads applied normal to the crack faces and even occurs under monotonic tensile loading. By closing small cracks and suppressing the propagation of others, this mechanism may provide a novel way of mitigating internal damage that influences ductility in nanocrystalline metals.},

abstract = {The theory of rubber elasticity relates the elastic modulus of unfilled amorphous rubber to the concentration of elastically effective strands. A theoretical relation between this concentration and the concentrations of potential entanglements, random tetrafunctional crosslinks, and chain ends was proposed recently. In the present work, the new relation was combined with the theory of rubber elasticity and verified experimentally. Polydimethylsiloxane samples were cured by 60Co irradiation and were extensively extracted to determine gel fraction, which was used to calculate concentrations of crosslinking and scission due to irradiation. Equilibrium modulus values determined from creep tests were in excellent agreement with those calculated using the new relation if the average spacing between potential entanglements is 116 (CH3)2SiO units. Thus, in typical commercial silicone rubbers, the contribution to the modulus from trapped entanglements is greater than the direct contribution from crosslinks. The new relation allows the calculation of crosslink concentrations from modulus measurements on other unfilled rubbers once the potential entanglement spacing of the polymer is determined.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

A low carbon steel having a ferrite/pearlite structure with second phases along grain boundaries was subjected to notch-tensile and three-point bending tests with/without hydrogen pre-charging. HMT was applied to tested specimens re-charged with hydrogen. Accumulation of hydrogen was confirmed in strain-concentrated areas as well as along grain boundaries and in pearlite. A noteworthy finding was a substantial increase in defects acting as traps of diffusive hydrogen when specimens were deformed in the presence of hydrogen. The increased defects were annealed out at temperatures as low as 150??C, indicating their point defect nature. Another finding was the appearance of a zone denuded of silver precipitation in highly strained areas such as near grain boundaries and the fracture surface, where tritium autoradiography revealed the evolution of defects having high binding energy with hydrogen. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We study a model of interacting particles in two dimensions to address the relation between crystal-crystal transformations and pressure-induced amorphization. On increasing pressure at very low temperature, our model undergoes a martensitic crystal-crystal transformation. The characteristics of the resulting polycrystalline structure depend on defect density, compression rate, and nucleation and growth barriers. We find two different limiting cases. In one of them the martensite crystals, once nucleated, grow easily perpendicularly to the invariant interface, and the final structure contains large crystals of the different martensite variants. Upon decompression almost every atom returns to its original position, and the original crystal is fully recovered. In the second limiting case, after nucleation the growth of martensite crystals is inhibited by energetic barriers. The final morphology in this case is that of a polycrystal with a very small crystal size. This may be taken to be amorphous if we have only access (as experimentally may be the case) to the angularly averaged structure factor. However, this `X-ray amorphous' material is anisotropic, and this shows up upon decompression, when it recovers the original crystalline structure with an orientation correlated with the one it had prior to compression. The memory effect of this X-ray amorphous material is a natural consequence of the memory effect associated to the underlying martensitic transformation. We suggest that this kind of mechanism is present in many of the experimental observations of the memory glass effect, in which a crystal with the original orientation is recovered from an apparently amorphous sample when pressure is released.},

@article{Barrera2016,
abstract = {It is well known that hydrogen can have a detrimental effect on the mechanical properties of metals. The aim here is to provide a fully coupled model of the HELP (Hydrogen Enhanced Local Plasticity) mechanism with hydrogen transport. Using the similarities between the heat and mass diffusion equations, a coupled temperature–displacement procedure has been adopted to allow the coupling between hydrogen diffusion and the mechanical behaviour of the material to be simulated. The diffusion equation takes into account the fact that hydrogen atoms reside in interstitial sites and in trapping sites such as dislocations. In the simulations presented here it is assumed that concentration of hydrogen at the dislocations is in equilibrium with the concentration in the matrix interstitial sites. The mechanical behaviour of the material is represented by an isotropic hardening law in which the flow stress decreases with increasing hydrogen content in the matrix which is evaluated by solving the fully coupled mechanical diffusion equations. We use the model to analyse the response of a plane strain component which contains deep and sharp doubled-edged notches. For highly constrained components of this type the hydrostatic component of stress scales with the local yield strength of the material. A high local hydrostatic stress would result in a high hydrogen concentration, but a high hydrogen concentration results in softening, i.e. a low yield strength, and therefore a low hydrostatic stress. These conflicting relationships result in a balance being achieved between hydrostatic stress, hydrogen concentration and yield strength, i.e. the response does not become unstable. Also there is a high degree of kinematic determinacy in the way which the component deforms, i.e. the strain pattern in the presence of hydrogen is very similar to that when there is no hydrogen. A consequence of these two effects is that softening of the constitutive response due to the presence of hydrogen, does not lead to localization of strain and a macroscopic brittle response. Softening must be combined with other degradation process for the material to embrittle.},

abstract = {(1x1) and (2x1) reconstructions of the (001) SrTiO3 surface were studied using the first-principles full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method. Surface energies were calculated as a function of TiO2 chemical potential, oxygen partial pressure and temperature. The (1x1) unreconstructed surfaces were found to be energetically stable for many of the conditions considered. Under conditions of very low oxygen partial pressure the (2x1) Ti2O3 reconstruction [Martin R. Castell, Surf. Sci. 505,1 (2002)] is stable. The question as to why STM images of the (1x1) surfaces have not been obtained was addressed by calculating charge densities for each surface. These suggest that the (2x1) reconstructions would be easier to image than the (1x1) surfaces. The possibility that the presence of oxygen vacancies would destabilise the ?1?1? surfaces was also investigated. If the (1x1) surfaces are unstable then there exists the further possibility that the (2x1) DL-TiO2 reconstruction [Natasha Erdman et al. Nature (London) 419,55 (2002)] is stable in a TiO2-rich environment and for pO2 {\textgreater} 10−18 atm.},

abstract = {The mechanical behaviour of nanocrystalline materials (that is, polycrystals with a grain size of less than 100 nm) remains controversial. Although it is commonly accepted that the intrinsic deformation behaviour of these materials arises from the interplay between dislocation and grain-boundary processes, little is known about the specific deformation mechanisms. Here we use large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations to elucidate this intricate interplay during room-temperature plastic deformation of model nanocrystalline Al microstructures. We demonstrate that, in contrast to coarse-grained Al, mechanical twinning may play an important role in the deformation behaviour of nanocrystalline Al. Our results illustrate that this type of simulation has now advanced to a level where it provides a powerful new tool for elucidating and quantifying--in a degree of detail not possible experimentally--the atomic-level mechanisms controlling the complex dislocation and grain-boundary processes in heavily deformed materials with a submicrometre grain size.},

Bulk properties are in reasonable agreement with available experimental data. The cementite local density of states shows predominantly metallic character, along with some polar covalent bonding contributions (charge transfer from iron to carbon) for both bulk and surfaces. We predict cementite surface energies in the range of 2.0-2.5 J/m2, most of which are lower than all pure Fe surface energies. In particular, we predict the Fe3C (0 0 1) surface to be the most stable and the Fe3C (1 0 0) surface to be the least stable. We show that greater stability is associated with localized Fe-C bonding at the surface, smoother surfaces created, e.g., by large C atom relaxation into the bulk, and more uniform coordination at the surface. The relatively greater stability of Fe3C surfaces is suggested to provide the driving force for cementite to form at the surfaces of bcc iron. Implications for the carburization erosion mechanism for steel, such as cracking and melting, are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Sutton1983,
abstract = {The results of the study of symmetrical tilt boundaries, reported in the preceding part I, are generalized to asymmetrical tilt boundaries. A classification of tilt boundaries in cubic crystals is developed that reveals which boundaries to choose in order to study equilibrium faceting or intrinsic grain boundary dislocations (g.b.ds) accommodating a misorientation. Two series of atomistic studies of asymmetrical tilt boundary structures are presented based on this classification. The first is a study of long-period ($\Sigma$$\backslash$leq 97) [1$\backslash$overline{\{}1{\}}0] asymmetrical tilt boundaries in aluminium. The aims of this study are to investigate whether these boundaries are composed of fundamental structural elements, in the same way as was found in part I for symmetrical tilt boundaries, and to see if localized, distinct stress fields of edge g.b.ds exist throughout the misorientation range. With use of the results of this study, and the principle of continuity of boundary structure enunciated in part I, the boundary unit representation of a $\Sigma$ = 1193 asymmetrical tilt boundary is derived as an example. It is generally found that the Burgers vectors of intrinsic secondary g.b.ds in tilt boundaries, based on favoured boundary reference structures, are non-primitive d.s.c. vectors. The reason for this is given and a simple formula is presented to derive the Burgers vectors of such dislocations for any favoured tilt boundary reference structure. It is pointed out that, in general, very low angle ($\theta$ {\textless} 1 degrees say) tilt boundaries cannot be described in terms of units from high angle tilt boundaries, and the transition from the low angle to high angle regimes is discussed. The second atomistic study is an investigation of equilibrium faceting of long-period $\Sigma$ = 3[1$\backslash$overline{\{}1{\}}0] tilt boundaries with use of an empirical potential for copper. The limitations of computer simulation methods using periodic border conditions to study faceting are stated. It is shown, however, that the constraints imposed by the use of periodic border conditions may be used in a positive sense to carry out the Wulff construction, and thereby deduce equilibrium faceting behaviour.},

@misc{Birch1986,
abstract = {Data of several kinds (ultrasonic, volumetric, shock compression) are combined to produce a set of isotherms for NaCl in the temperature-pressure region between 25° and 500°C and 0–300 kbar. A preliminary examination of the Boehler-Kennedy measurements of linear compression to 30 kbar and 500°C supports the provisional assumption that (∂P/∂T) v is independent of P and possibly also of T in the “high-temperature” domain. The equation of state may consequently take the form P(V, t) = P 25(V) + (t − 25)(∂P/∂T) v , where t is Celsius temperature. P 25(V) is the 25°C isotherm of an earlier paper, with small adjustments; this equation was controlled at 300 kbar by the shock measurements and at zero pressure by ultrasonic measurements. Isotherms of the BE2 form are constructed for the five additional temperatures of the Boehler-Kennedy data with (∂P/∂T) v = 0.0286 kbar/deg. These are in nearly as good agreement with the volumetric data as were the curves fitted to these measurements alone. At the same time, the parameters of these isotherms show a regular dependence upon temperature. Various thermo dynamic parameters are tabulated, with the aid of handbook values of CP and zero-pressure thermal expansion coefficients. In particular, Gr{\"{u}}neisen's ratio $\gamma$ is found to be nearly independent of temperature, while $\gamma$/V is nearly independent of pressure.},

Two versions of the model for either static or dynamic conditions, i.e. zero or non-zero temperature, are described. The model is tested for elastic response of a perfect crystal and the atomic properties of a 1/2{\textless}111{\textgreater} edge dislocation in a model of bcc Fe. Several examples of dislocation glide behaviour and dislocation–obstacle interactions at zero and non-zero temperature are presented and discussed.},

abstract = {The performance of four recent semi-empirical interatomic potentials for iron, developed or used within the FP6 Perfect Project, is evaluated by comparing them between themselves and with available experimental or, more often, density functional theory data. The quantities chosen for the comparison are of specific interest for radiation damage studies, i.e. they concern mainly properties of point-defects and their clusters, as well as dislocations. For completeness, an earlier, widely used (also within the Project) iron potential is included in the comparison exercise as well. This exercise allows conclusions to be drawn about the reliability of the available potentials, while providing a snapshot of the state-of-the-art concerning fundamental properties of iron, thereby being also useful as a kind of handbook and as a framework for the validation of future semi-empirical interatomic potentials for iron. It is found that Mendelev-type potentials are currently the best choice in order to "extend density functional theory" to larger scales and this justifies their widespread use, also for the development of iron alloy potentials. However, a fully reliable description of self-interstitial atom clusters and dislocations with interatomic potentials remains largely an elusive objective, that calls for further effort within the concerned scientific community. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Evolutionary crystal structure prediction proved to be a powerful approach in discovering new materials. Certain limitations are encountered for systems with a large number of degrees of freedom ("large systems") and complex energy landscapes ("complex systems"). We explore the nature of these limitations and address them with a number of newly developed tools. For large systems a major problem is the lack of diversity: any randomly produced population consists predominantly of high-energy disordered structures, offering virtually no routes toward the ordered ground state. We offer two solutions: first, modified variation operators that favor atoms with higher local order (a function we introduce here), and, second, construction of the first generation non-randomly, using pseudo-subcells with, in general, fractional atomic occupancies. This enhances order and diversity and improves energies of the structures. We introduce an additional variation operator, coordinate mutation, which applies preferentially to low-order ("badly placed") atoms. Biasing other variation operators by local order is also found to produce improved results. One promising version of coordinate mutation, explored here, displaces atoms along the eigenvector of the lowest-frequency vibrational mode. For complex energy landscapes, the key problem is the possible existence of several energy funnels - in this situation it is possible to get trapped in one funnel (not necessarily containing the ground state). To address this problem, we develop an algorithm incorporating the ideas of abstract "distance" between structures. These new ingredients improve the performance of the evolutionary algorithm USPEX, in terms of efficiency and reliability, for large and complex systems. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The degree of friction modification is surveyed as a function of wall separation, sliding velocity, additive molecular weight and architecture, and oil–additive composition. As a rule, the kinetic-friction coefficient is found to increase first linearly and then logarithmically with increasing sliding velocity. From the results for different additive molecules, some subtle but systematic effects are found that point towards an optimum molecular weight and architecture.},

The influence of Cr-doping on the surface stability of the cementite was analyzed and predicted. The results show that at a temperature of 0 K and under a pressure of 0 GPa, the surface stability of both Fe3C and Fe2CrC gradually decreased from (001) and (010) to (100), with each Fe2CrC surface being less stable than the corresponding Fe 3C surface. Cr-doping can weaken the strength of the Fe-C bond in the cementite, and stronger surface localized Fe-C bonds may be one of the main reasons for greater surface stability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

So far, atomistic simulations of this process have predicted Peierls stresses, the stress needed to overcome the crystal resistance in the absence of thermal fluctuations, of more than twice the experimental values, a discrepancy best-known in body-centred cubic crystals. Here we show that a large contribution arises from the crystal zero-point vibrations, which ease dislocation motion below typically half the Debye temperature. Using Wigner's quantum transition state theory in atomistic models of crystals, we found a large decrease of the kink-pair formation enthalpy due to the quantization of the crystal vibrational modes. Consequently, the flow stress predicted by Orowan's law is strongly reduced when compared with its classical approximation and in much closer agreement with experiments.

abstract = {This chapter presents the major findings of the experiments undertaken to examine the hydrogen diffusion paths in various steels using high sensitivity hydrogen microprint technique (HMT). This technique utilizes a reduction effect of hydrogen atoms released from the specimen surface, and hydrogen exit sites are visualized as silver (Ag) particles reduced by hydrogen. One of the findings is that the crystal lattice serves as the main diffusion path (diffusion within grains) in extremely low-carbon steel. No accelerated diffusion of hydrogen is observed along grain boundaries. Another finding, in hypoeutectoid steel, proeutectoid ferrite, and ferrite distributed within pearlite serves as main diffusion paths for hydrogen. Under nonsteady-state charging, hydrogen diffuses along the carbide-ferrite interface that favors the trapping effect. The interface of martensitic laths serves as a hydrogen diffusion path in tempered martensitic steel. High sensitivity HMT has a spatial resolution of the order of 0.1 ??m. Diffusion paths of hydrogen in tempered martensitic steel containing many carbides is easier to reveal by using backscattered electron (BSE) images in addition to HMT. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

In particular, nanoscale slip is numerically quantified and a semi-analytical model for surface slip variation with pressure, film thickness and sliding velocity is presented. A composite model involving both continuum mechanics and nanoscale effects allows for a better understanding of dimple formation and offers a new basis towards a physically based friction prediction. This tentative represents a new direction towards a more realistic modelling of lubricated contacts with ultra thin film for the present industrial needs.},

abstract = {The two-dimensional crystalline structures in graphene challenge the applicability of existing theories that have been used for characterizing its three-dimensional counterparts. It is crucial to establish reliable structure-property relationships in the important two-dimensional crystals to fully use their remarkable properties. With the success in synthesizing large-area polycrystalline graphene, understanding how grain boundaries (GBs) in graphene alter its physical properties is of both scientific and technological importance. A recent work showed that more GB defects could counter intuitively give rise to higher strength in tilt GBs (ref. 10). We show here that GB strength can either increase or decrease with the tilt, and the behaviour can be explained well by continuum mechanics. It is not just the density of defects that affects the mechanical properties, but the detailed arrangements of defects are also important. The strengths of tilt GBs increase as the square of the tilt angles if pentagon-heptagon defects are evenly spaced, and the trend breaks down in other cases. We find that mechanical failure always starts from the bond shared by hexagon-heptagon rings. Our present work provides fundamental guidance towards understanding how defects interact in two-dimensional crystals, which is important for using high-strength and stretchable graphene for biological and electronic applications.},

G is the shear modulus in Mdyn cm-2 at a temperature T for natural rubber cross-linked by adding p parts of dicumyl peroxide per hundred of rubber (phr) and heating until a fraction f of the peroxide is decomposed. G*, the energy component of the modulus, is H(fp + B) + A. The ratio G*/G decreases from 1.00 at the gel point (fp = 0.45 phr) to 0.5 near 2 phr and to 0.09 at 23.8 phr. The modulus G is related to ve, the number of moles of effective sub-chains per cm3, by the equation G - G* = veRT where R is the gas constant. If each molecule of decomposed dicumyl peroxide of molecular weight Md produces one cross-link in the rubber of specific volume vr, then it is predicted that S = 2R(100Mdvr)-1 = 5.5535 X 10-3 Mdyn cm-2 phr-1 K-1, as compared with the experimental value 5.925 X 10-3. Theory gives no prediction of the values of A, or of H. The gel point may be located experimentally as the point where the slope of the modulus-temperature relation is zero. The value of G at the gel point is the energy component G*. The experimental value of fp at the gel point permits a calculation of the molecular weight of the rubber before cross-linking as 193,000. The results afford a very satisfactory confirmation of the essential validity of the statistical theory of rubber elasticity in its simplest form, if due regard is paid to G*, the energy component of the modulus.},

The analysis of the dislocation core structures revealed that the basal slip system was the most favorable energetically, and therefore a dislocation loop cannot extend on the pyramidal slip plane, because screw dislocations were not stable in this slip plane. In agreement with experimental data, a strong anisotropy between slip systems was observed. In both the basal and the prismatic slip planes, the dislocation velocity is consistent with phonon drag theory. In addition, the edge dislocation velocity was always larger than the screw dislocation velocity independent of the slip system, while the dislocation velocity on the prismatic slip plane was always lower than the dislocation velocity on the basal plane regardless of the dislocation character.},

The potential was used in tandem with molecular-dynamics simulations to calculate the thermal expansion of both BCC-Fe and FCC-Fe, the phonon dispersion curves, mean-square displacements and surface relaxations of the element. In addition, we have studied self-diffusion of single adatoms on the BCC-Fe(1 0 0) surface at several temperatures. The migration energies and pre-exponential factors for three main diffusion mechanisms were determined and compared with available experimental data. We have found that the diagonal exchange diffusion process is energetically favored over the direct hopping mechanism and that its migration energy is close to the experimental value. Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient associated with the diagonal exchange diffusion process is about an order of magnitude higher than those of the hopping and the non-diagonal exchange mechanisms. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An increased coverage generally resulted in lower lateral (friction) forces due to reductions in both the friction coefficient and Derjaguin offset. Rougher surfaces led to more liquidlike, disordered films; however, the friction coefficient and Derjaguin offset were only slightly increased. This suggests that stearic acid films are almost as effective on contact surfaces with nanoscale roughness as those which are atomically-smooth.},

abstract = {A density-functional theory based empirical potential was used to explore the energies of different types of Fe grain boundaries and free surfaces in thermodynamic equilibrium with a hydrogen environment. The classical model for calculating the ideal work of separation with solute atoms is extended to account for every trapping site. This yields the lowest-energy structures at different hydrogen chemical potentials (or gas pressures). At hydrogen gas pressures lower than 1000 atm, the reduction of the reversible work of separation is less than 33{\%} and it increases to 36{\%} at a gas pressure of 5000 atm. Near the hydride formation limit, 5 × 104 atm, the reduction is 44{\%}. Based on the magnitude of these reductions for complete decohesion, and accounting for experimental observations of the microstructure associated with hydrogen-induced intergranular fracture of Fe, it is posited that hydrogen-enhanced plasticity and attendant effects establish the local conditions responsible for the transition in fracture mode from transgranular to intergranular. The conclusion is reached that intergranular failure occurs by a reduction of the cohesive energy but with contributions from structural as well as compositional changes in the grain boundary that are driven by hydrogen-enhanced plasticity processes.},

Here we show that the prevalent formation of cementite can be explained only by considering its stability at elevated temperature. A systematic highly accurate quantum mechanical study was conducted on the stability of binary iron carbides. The calculations show that all the iron carbides are unstable relative to the elemental solids, $\alpha$-Fe and graphite. Apart from a cubic Fe23C6 phase, the energetically most favorable carbides exhibit hexagonal close-packed Fe sublattices. Finite-temperature analysis showed that contributions from lattice vibration and anomalous Curie-Weis magnetic ordering, rather than from the conventional lattice mismatch with the matrix, are the origin of the predominance of cementite during steel fabrication processes.},

abstract = {A theoretical formalism to calculate the single crystalelastic constants for orthorhombic crystals from first principle calculations is described. This is applied for TiSi 2 and we calculate the elastic constants using a full potential linear muffin-tin orbital method using the local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The calculated values compare favorably with recent experimental results. An expression to calculate the bulk modulus along crystallographic axes of single crystals, using elastic constants, has been derived. From this the calculated linear bulk moduli are found to be in good agreement with the experiments. The shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio for ideal polycrystalline TiSi 2 are also calculated and compared with corresponding experimental values. The directional bulk modulus and the Young's modulus for single crystal TiSi 2 are estimated from the elastic constants obtained from LDA as well as GGA calculations and are compared with the experimental results. The shear anisotropic factors and anisotropy in the linear bulk modulus are obtained from the single crystalelastic constants. From the site and angular momentum decomposed density of states combined with a charge density analysis and the elasticanisotropies, the chemical bonding nature between the constituents in TiSi 2 is analyzed. The Debye temperature is calculated from the average elastic wave velocity obtained from shear and bulk modulus as well as the integration of elastic wave velocities in different directions of the single crystal. The calculated elastic properties are found to be in good agreement with experimental values when the generalized gradient approximation is used for the exchange and correlation potential.},

abstract = {Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) is a well-known material phenomenon that causes significant loss in the mechanical strength of structural iron and often leads to catastrophic failures. In order to provide a detailed atomistic description of HE we have used a reactive bond order potential to adequately describe the diffusion of hydrogen as well as its chemical interaction with other hydrogen atoms, defects, and the host metal. The currently published ReaxFF force field for Fe/C/H systems was originally developed to describe Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysis [C. Zou, A. C. T. van Duin and D. C. Sorescu, Top. Catal., 2012, 55, 391-401], and especially had been trained for surface formation energies, binding energies of small hydrocarbon radicals on different surfaces of iron and the barrier heights of surface reactions. We merged this force field with the latest ReaxFF carbon parameters [S. Goverapet Srinivasan, A. C. T. van Duin and P. Ganesh, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2015, 119, 1089-5639] and used the same training data set to refit the Fe/C interaction parameters. The present work is focused on evaluating the applicability of this reactive force field to describe material characteristics and study the role of defects and impurities in the bulk and at the precipitator interfaces. We study the interactions of hydrogen with pure and defective [small alpha]-iron (ferrite), Fe3C (cementite), and ferrite-cementite interfaces with a vacancy cluster. We also investigate the growth of nanovoids in [small alpha]-iron using a grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) scheme. The calculated hydrogen diffusion coefficients for both ferrite and cementite phases predict a decrease in the work of separation with increasing hydrogen concentration at the ferrite-cementite interface, suggesting a hydrogen-induced decohesion behavior. Hydrogen accumulation at the interface was observed during molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which is consistent with experimental findings. These results demonstrate the ability of the ReaxFF potential to elucidate various aspects of hydrogen embrittlement in [small alpha]-iron and hydrogen interactions at a more complex metal/metal carbide interface.},

However, experiments indicate that NbCr2 is a brittle phase at room temperature with the fracture toughness of 1.0-1.4 MPa m1/2. NbCr2 is hence a compound with its ductile and brittle behavior beyond Pugh's criterion, and this finding also validates for other Laves phases and compounds. New insight into Pugh's B/G criterion is also discussed.},

The mechanisms governing the tribofilm growth are not well understood, which limits the development of replacements that offer better performance and are less likely to degrade automobile catalytic converters over time. Using atomic force microscopy in ZDDP-containing lubricant base stock at elevated temperatures, we monitored the growth and properties of the tribofilms in situ in well-defined single-asperity sliding nanocontacts. Surface-based nucleation, growth, and thickness saturation of patchy tribofilms were observed. The growth rate increased exponentially with either applied compressive stress or temperature, consistent with a thermally activated, stress-assisted reaction rate model. Although some models rely on the presence of iron to catalyze tribofilm growth, the films grew regardless of the presence of iron on either the tip or substrate, highlighting the critical role of stress and thermal activation.},

abstract = {For the successful development and application of lubricants, a full understanding of their complex nanoscale behavior under a wide range of external conditions is required, but this is difficult to obtain experimentally. Nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations can be used to yield unique insights into the atomic-scale structure and friction of lubricants and additives; however, the accuracy of the results depend on the chosen force-field. In this study, we demonstrate that the use of an accurate, all-atom force-field is critical in order to; (i) accurately predict important properties of long-chain, linear molecules; and (ii) reproduce experimental friction behavior of multi-component tribological systems. In particular, we focus on n-hexadecane, an important model lubricant with a wide range of industrial applications. Moreover, simulating conditions common in tribological systems, i.e., high temperatures and pressures (HTHP), allows the limits of the selected force-fields to be tested. In the first section, a large number of united-atom and all-atom force-fields are benchmarked in terms of their density and viscosity prediction accuracy of n-hexadecane using equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations at ambient and HTHP conditions. Whilst united-atom force-fields accurately reproduce experimental density, the viscosity is significantly under-predicted compared to all-atom force-fields and experiments. Moreover, some all-tom force-fields yield elevated melting points, leading to significant overestimation of both the density and viscosity. In the second section, the most accurate united-atom and all-atom force-field are compared in confined NEMD simulations which probe the structure and friction of stearic acid adsorbed on iron oxide and separated by a thin layer of n-hexadecane. The united-atom force-field provides an accurate representation of the structure of the confined stearic acid film; however, friction coefficients are consistently under-predicted and the friction-coverage and friction-velocity behavior deviates from that observed using all-atom force-fields and experimentally. This has important implications regarding force-field selection for NEMD simulations of systems containing long-chain, linear molecules; specifically, it is recommended that accurate all-atom potentials, such as L-OPLS-AA, are employed.},

abstract = {In order to understand the adsorption mechanism of metal atoms to semiconducting surfaces, we have studied, as a model system, the vapor phase adsorption of Ag, Au, and Cu on the (001) surface of molybdenite (MoS2) and the subsequent surface diffusion of these adsorbates. Our scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images show that, depending on the type of metal atom that is adsorbed, islands of a characteristic size (2 nm for Ag, 8 to 10 nm for Cu, two distinct sizes of 2 nm and 8 to 10 nm for Au), shape (well rounded in the lateral extension) and thickness (one monolayer for Ag, 1 to 1.5 nm for Cu) are formed during the initial stages of deposition. Whole islands are observed to surface diffuse without loss of size or shape. Despite the relatively large size of the copper islands on molybdenite, these islands surface diffuse extensively, suggesting that the Cu-S interaction is weak. Surface diffusion is only hindered once individual islands start to coalesce. As copper islands accumulate, the size and shape of the original islands can still be recognized, supporting the conclusion that these characteristics are constant and that monolayer growth occurs by the aggregation of islands across the surface. The strength and the nature of the Ag-S(MoS2) bond were further investigated by using molecular orbital calculations, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS). By applying quantum mechanical approaches using a two-dimensional periodic molybdenite slab and hexagonal MoS2 clusters of different sizes with metal atoms adsorbed to them, it is possible to calculate the electron transfer between the mineral surface and the metal atom as well as the adsorption energy as a function of surface coverage. In addition, we used the results from the quantum mechanical runs to derive empirical potentials that model the characteristics of the forces within the crystal, within the adsorbed islands, and the metal and mineral surface. The combination of quantum mechanical calculations and empirical force field calculations explain the electronic structure and the highest stability of Ag islands that have seven atoms in diameter, which exactly agrees with the size of experimentally observed islands. UPS results also suggest that a specific new state is formed (approximately 4.5 eV into the valence band) which may describe the Ag-S bond because it does not occur in pure silver or molybdenite. This study shows how the combination of microscopic (STM), spectroscopic (STS, UPS), compositional (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS) and molecular modeling (quantum mechanical and empirical) techniques is a useful approach to understand the nature of the metal to sulfide bond. Further insights may be gained concerning the natural association of certain metals with sulfides. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {First principle calculations have been performed to study the crystalline, electronic, and magnetic structures of three iron-carbide systems: $\theta$-Fe3C, $\chi$-Fe5C2, and $\eta$-Fe2C. The Kohn-Sham equations were solved by applying the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method. The generalized gradient approximation in the Perdew-Wang formalism was used to the exchange and correlation energy functional. The internal positions of atoms within the unit cell were optimized and the ground state properties such as lattice parameter and bulk modulus were calculated. The results are compared with experimental data when available. Comparison of the two metastable systems $\chi$-Fe5C2 and $\eta$-Fe2C shows that the last one has lower formation energy; this is corroborated by the formation sequence observed during tempering. The electronic structures of the three carbides were then studied and the magnetic moments calculated by means of electronic spin-resolved density of state calculations at their equilibrium lattice constants and optimized internal parameters.},

abstract = {A set of modified embedded-atom method (MEAM) potentials for the interactions between Al, Si, Mg, Cu, and Fe was developed from a combination of each element's MEAM potential in order to study metal alloying. Previously published MEAM parameters of single elements have been improved for better agreement to the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) curves when compared with ab initio generated GSFE curves. The MEAM parameters for element pairs were constructed based on the structural and elastic properties of element pairs in the NaCl reference structure garnered from ab initio calculations, with adjustment to reproduce the ab initio heat of formation of the most stable binary compounds. The new MEAM potentials were validated by comparing the formation energies of defects, equilibrium volumes, elastic moduli, and heat of formation for several binary compounds with ab initio simulations and experiments. Single elements in their ground-state crystal structure were subjected to heating to test the potentials at elevated temperatures. An Al potential was modified to avoid formation of an unphysical solid structure at high temperatures. The thermal expansion coefficient of a compound with the composition of AA 6061 alloy was evaluated and compared with experimental values. MEAM potential tests performed in this work, utilizing the universal atomistic simulation environment (ASE), are distributed to facilitate reproducibility of the results.},

abstract = {The properties of butane (C4H10) lubricants confined between two approaching solids are investigated by a model that accounts for the curvature and elastic properties of the solid surfaces. We consider the linear n-butane and the branched isobutane. For the linear molecule, well defined molecular layers develop in the lubricant film when the width is of the order of a few atomic diameters. The branched isobutane forms more disordered structures which permit it to stay liquidlike at smaller surface separations. During squeezing the solvation forces show oscillations corresponding to the width of a molecule. At low speeds ({\textless}0.1 ms) the last layers of isobutane are squeezed out before those of n-butane. Since the (interfacial) squeezing velocity in most practical applications is very low when the lubricant layer has molecular thickness, one expects n-butane to be a better boundary lubricant than isobutane. With n-butane possessing a slightly lower viscosity at high pressures, our result refutes the view that squeeze-out should be harder for higher viscosities; on the other hand our results are consistent with wear experiments in which n-butane were shown to protect steel surfaces better than isobutane.},

abstract = {Accurate force fields are essential for reproducing the conformational and dynamic behavior of condensed-phase systems. The popular AMBER force field has parameters for monophosphates, but they do not extend well to polyphorylated molecules such as ADP and ATP. This work presents parameters for the partial charges, atom types, bond angles, and torsions in simple polyphosphorylated compounds. The parameters are based on molecular orbital calculations of methyldiphosphate and methyltriphosphate at the RHF/6-31+G* level. The new parameters were fit to the entire potential energy surface (not just minima) with an RMSD of 0.62 kcal/mol. This is exceptional agreement and a significant improvement over the current parameters that produce a potential surface with an RMSD of 7.8 kcal/mol to that of the ab initio calculations. Testing has shown that the parameters are transferable and capable of reproducing the gas-phase conformations of inorganic diphosphate and triphosphate. Also, the parameters are an improvement over existing parameters in the condensed phase as shown by minimizations of ATP bound in several proteins. These parameters are intended for use with the existing AMBER 94/99 force field, and they will permit users to apply AMBER to a wider variety of important enzymatic systems.},

abstract = {We present temperature-dependent atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements in force-distance mode of confined 1-dodecanol. Upon approach of the AFM-tip toward the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface, the final liquid film--only a few nanometers thin--is squeezed out in discrete layers. We find that both the force needed to squeeze out these layers and the number of structured layers strongly increase as the freezing temperature is approached. Surprisingly the force increases nonmonotonically and show a local maximum around 3 degrees and a local minimum at 1 degree above the bulk melting point of the liquid. We attribute this result to changes in epitaxial effects between 1-dodecanol and the HOPG surface close to the melting point of the liquid. To test this hypothesis we performed the same measurements in hexadecane, a similar carbon-chain molecule, and octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (OMCTS), a quasi-spherical molecule. Hexadecane shows the same maximum in the squeeze-out force at 4-5 degrees and a minimum at 1-2 degrees above the freezing temperature of the liquid, while the squeeze-out of OMCTS was found to be independent of temperature.},

abstract = {The effect of solute hydrogen on the stability of vacancy clusters in hexagonal closed packed zirconium is investigated with an ab initioapproach, including contributions of H vibrations. Atomistic simulations within the density functional theory evidence a strong binding of H to small vacancy clusters. The hydrogen effect on large vacancy loops is modeled through its interaction with the stacking faults. A thermodynamic modeling of H segregation on the various faults, relying on ab initiobinding energies, shows that these faults are enriched in H, leading to a decrease of the stacking fault energies. This is consistent with the trapping of H by vacancy loops observed experimentally. The stronger trapping, and thus the stronger stabilization, is obtained for vacancy loops lying in the basal planes, i.e.the loops responsible for the breakaway growth observed under high irradiation dose.},

abstract = {{\{}The thermal properties of the 14 nonmagnetic cubic metals through the 4d transition series are derived from 6rst-princip{\}}es electronic-structure calculations coupled with a Debye treatment of the vibrating lattice. Debye temperatures and Gruneisen constants are derived from an analysis of the compressional characteristics of rigid-lattice binding curves and are used to de6ne the contri- bution of the lattice vibrations to the free energy. A minimization of the resulting free energy with respect to volume yields temperature-dependent lattice separations and coeScients of thermal expansion. Theoretical values of cohesive energies, equilibrium lattice separations, bulk moduli, Debye temperatures, Gruneisen constants, and coeScients of thermal expansion are derived direct- ly from computed electronic-structure results. Good agreement with experiment is found for all computed quantities.},

@article{Cui1996,
abstract = {Extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out for liquid decane, hexadecane, and tetracosane at densities corresponding to atmospheric pressure and near ambient temperatures. The strain-rate-dependent viscosity has been obtained for strain rates ranging over several orders of magnitude. At high strain rate, the viscosities for all alkanes studied here have similar values and exhibit similar power-law shear-thinning behavior with a slope between about -0.40 and -0.33. Accompanying this shear thinning is the onset of orientational order and the alignment of the alkane molecules with the flow direction. The alignment angle tends to 45 degrees at very low strain rate and is significantly smaller at high strain rate, This suggests that the chains substantially align in the flow direction and that the dominant motion at high strain rate is the sliding of the chains parallel to the flow. At low strain rate, the shear viscosity shows a transition to Newtonian behavior. The Newtonian viscosity can be obtained from the plateau value of the shear viscosity at the lowest strain rates calculated from the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation (NEMD). This is demonstrated by comparing the viscosity of decane obtained by extrapolating the NEMD simulation with an independent calculation using the standard Green-Kubo method. The transition from the non-Newtonian regime to the Newtonian regime is also correlated with the disappearance of orientational order and with the longest relaxation time of the liquid alkanes simulated.

abstract = {An artificial neural network has been proved to be a sufficient tool for modelling fatigue life of multidirectional composite laminates made of GFRP composite materials and tested under constant amplitude loading patterns. Modelling efficiency of the network was satisfactory for both on- and off-axis coupons' life, irrespective of the test conditions, i.e., R-ratio that defines the developed stress state on the coupon. Tension–Tension, Compression–Compression and even Tension–Compression loading patterns were investigated and modelling accuracy of the proposed ANN model was validated. The main benefit of this new modelling tool is that only a small portion, in the range of 40–50{\%}, of the experimental data is needed for the whole analysis. Thus, expensive and time consuming tests required by the conventional way for the establishment of S–N curves could be significantly reduced without significant loss of accuracy. We applied the neural network method using experimental data from two different (in nature) material systems and proved that constant life diagrams (CLDs), which are very useful for the design of structures loaded under variable amplitude loading spectra, can be efficiently modelled using a much smaller set of experimental data compared to that needed for the development of CLDs by the conventional way.},

abstract = {This study concerns with fault diagnosis of low speed bearing using multi-class relevance vector machine (RVM) and support vector machine (SVM). A low speed test rig was developed to simulate various types of bearing defects associated with shaft speeds as low as 10rpm under several loading conditions. The data was acquired from the low speed bearing test rig using acoustic emission (AE) and accelerometer sensors under a constant load with different speeds. The aim of this study is to address the problem of detecting an incipient bearing fault and to find reliable methods for low speed machine fault diagnosis. In this paper, two methods of multi-class classification techniques for fault diagnosis through RVM and SVM are presented and the effectiveness of using AE and vibration signals due to low impact rate for low speed diagnosis. In the present study, component analysis was performed initially to extract the features and to reduce the dimensionality of original data features. The classification for fault diagnosis was also conducted using original data feature and without feature extraction. The result shows that multi-class RVM produces promising results and has the potential for use in fault diagnosis of low speed machine.},

The changes in the electronic structure of bcc Fe upon the introduction of H at a vacancy are addressed, and a comparison drawn with H adsorption at the Fe(110) surface. H in bulk Fe with vacancies prefers a tetrahedral site shifted toward the vacancy. The vacancies act as a strong trap for H. The Fe atoms are initially more strongly bonded to each other as a consequence of vacancy formation; their Fe–Fe bond strength is then diminished as the new Fe–H bond is formed. The effect of H is limited to its first Fe neighbor. An analysis of the orbital interactions reveals that the Fe–H bonding involves mainly the Fe 4s and H 1s orbitals with less participation of Fe 4p and 3d crystal orbitals. Relaxation of Fe atoms neighboring the vacancy is also addressed. A detailed atomistic mechanism for decohesion and H embrittlement is provided.},

@article{Tehranchi2017a,
abstract = {Hydrogen atoms have a wide variety of effects on the mechanical performance of metals, and the underlying mechanisms associated with effects on plastic flow and embrittlement remain to be discovered or validated. Here, the reduction in the plastic flow stress (softening) due to hydrogen atoms in solute-strengthened metals, previously proposed by Sofronis et al. is demonstrated at the atomistic level. Glide of an edge dislocation through a field of solutes in a nickel matrix, both in the absence of hydrogen and in the presence of H bound to the solutes, is modelled. The 'solutes' here are represented by vacancies, enabling use of accurate binary Ni–H interatomic potentials. Since vacancies have a misfit strain tensor in the Ni matrix and also bind hydrogen atoms, they are excellent surrogates for study of the general phenomenon. The binding of H to the solute (vacancy) reduces the misfit volume to nearly zero but also creates a non-zero tetragonal distortion. Solute strengthening theory is used to establish the connection between strength and solute/hydrogen concentration and misfit strain tensor. Simulations show that when a dislocation moves through a field of random vacancy 'solutes', the glide stress is reduced (softening) when H is bound to the solutes. Trends in the simulations are consistent with theory predictions. Trends of softening or hardening by H in metal alloys can thus be made by computing the misfit strain tensor for a desired solute in the chosen matrix with and without bound hydrogen atoms. Pursuing this, density functional theory calculations of the interaction of H with carbon and sulphur solutes in a Ni matrix are presented. These solutes/impurities do not bind with H and the complexes have larger misfit strains, indicative of H-induced strengthening rather than softening for these cases. Nonetheless, H/solute interactions are the only mechanism, to date, that shows nanoscale evidence of plastic softening due to hydrogen associated with the hydrogen-enhanced localised plasticity concept in fcc metals.},

The stability of different self-interstitial structures has been further studied and it is particularly shown that hydrogen plays a crucial role in determining the configuration of SIAs, in which the hexagonal cluster structure is preferred. Energetic analysis has been carried out to prove that the formation of SIA clusters facilitates the formation of vacancies.

abstract = {Equilibrium structures, solvation forces, and conformational dynamics of thin confined films of n-hexadecane and squalane are investigated using a new grand canonical ensemble molecular dynamics method for simulations of confined liquids. The method combines constant pressure simulations with a computational cell containing solid surfaces and both bulk and confined liquid regions in equilibrium with each other. For both molecular liquids layered density oscillations in the confined films are found for various widths of the confining gap. The solvation force oscillations as a function of the gap width for the straight chain n-hexadecane liquid are more pronounced exhibiting attractive and repulsive regions, while for the branched alkane the solvation forces are mostly repulsive, with the development of shallow local attractive regions for small values of the gap width. Furthermore, the nature of the transitions between well-formed layered configurations is different in the two systems, with the n-hexadecane film exhibiting solid-like characteristics portrayed by step-like variations in the number of confined segments occurring in response to a small decrease in the gap width, starting from well-layered states of the film. On the other hand the behavior of the squalane film is liquid-like, exhibiting a monotonic continuous decrease in the number of confined segments as the gap width is decreased. These characteristics are correlated with structural properties of the confined films which, for n-hexadecane, exhibit enhanced layered ordering and in-plane ordered molecular arrangements, as well as with the relatively high tendency for interlayer molecular interdigitation in the squalane films. Reduced conformational ͑trans-guache͒ transition rates in the confined films, compared to their bulk values, are found, and their oscillatory dependence on the degree of confinement is analyzed, showing smaller transition rates for the well-formed layered states of the films.},

abstract = {Molecular-dynamics simulations are used to gain insights on recent sum-frequency spectroscopy and polarised neutron reflectometry measurements of the structure of hexadecylamine films adsorbed on iron-oxide surfaces in dodecane and hexadecane. Simulations were carried out under quiescent and high-shear conditions. Mass-density profiles, molecular-height and molecular-orientation probability distribution functions, and in-layer radial distribution functions were calculated. The simulation results show that at high surface coverage, the film thickness is about 15 {\AA}, and that the molecules are mainly pointing upwards from the surface at an angle of 40–501. The results are compared critically against published experimental results, and the agreement is found to be good. The in-layer ordering of the hexadecylamine head-group atoms is found to be dictated by the crystalline structure of the iron-oxide surface, but this influence rapidly diminishes along the molecular backbone. The tail-group atoms show almost no positional ordering. Finally, an example calculation of the kinetic friction coefficient under high-shear conditions is presented. The lateral (friction) force is measured as a function of the normal (applied) force, and the kinetic friction coefficient is determined to be about 0.09, which is typical for this kind of system.},

abstract = {Software for calculation of phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties have been developed since the 1970's. Software and computers have now developed to a level where such calculations can be used as tools for material and process development. In the present paper some of the latest software developments at Thermo-Calc Software are presented together with application examples. It is shown how advanced thermodynamic calculations have become more accessible since: A more user-friendly windows version of Thermo-Calc, TCW, has been developed. There is an increasing amount of thermodynamic databases for different materials available. Thermo-Calc can be accessed from user-written software through several different programming interfaces are available which enables access to the thermodynamic software from a user-written software. Accurate data for thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria can then easily be incorporated into software written in e.g. C++, Matlab and FORTRAN. Thermo-Calc Software also produces DICTRA, a software for simulation of diffusion controlled phase transformations. Using DICTRA it is possible to simulate processes such as homogenization, carburising, microsegregation and coarsening in multicomponent alloys. The different models in the DICTRA software are briefly presented in the present paper together with some application examples. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This problem is relevant for biological, as well as for bio-medical, seals and tires applications. An ad-hoc numerical scheme is developed to solve the transient mixed-EHD homogenized lubrication problem. We show that, for the soft contact case, the transition from the EHD to the boundary regime can be much more efficiently studied within a simplified (Grubin-like) problem formulation then with the full numerical scheme. This is not only of great conceptional importance, but also of practical importance as the latter calculation is much simpler and faster than the full scheme calculation.},

@article{Sangid2013,
abstract = {The fatigue life of a component can be expressed as the sum of two segments of life: (a) the number of loading cycles required to initiate a crack and (b) the number of cycles it takes that crack to propagate to failure. In this review, the primary emphasis is relating the fatigue crack initiation to the microstructure of the material. Many studies have focused on this phenomenon over the years and the goal of this paper is to put this work in perspective and encourage future work of fatigue in polycrystals based on the material's microstructure. In order to address fatigue, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms that facilitate crack initiation. Slip irreversibilities exist in a material and accumulate during fatigue loading. At the defect level, irreversibilities are a result of dislocations: annihilating, cross-slipping, penetrating precipitates, transmitting through grain boundaries, and piling-up. These slip irreversibilities are the early signs of damage during cyclic loading. The dislocations subsequently form low-energy, stable structures as a means to accommodate the irreversible slip processes and increasing dislocation density during cyclic forward and reverse loading. The result is strain localizing in a small region within the materials, i.e. persistent slip bands and dislocation cells/bundles. Strain localization is a precursor to crack initiation. This review paper will focus on experimental observations of strain localization and the theory and numerical analysis of both slip irreversibilities and low energy configuration defect structures. This fundamental understanding is necessary to study persistent slip bands in FCC metals and alloys including the appropriate characterization, theory, and modeling. From this fundamental knowledge both micromechanical and crystal plasticity models can be used to predict crack initiation, which are also reviewed. Finally, this review ends with a discussion of the future of fatigue modeling and experiments. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

While the conventional methods calculating multiaxial fatigue life with critical plane model require very long-time, this method outputs instantaneously result for a given set of input after the ANN model has been trained. The performance of the ANN model was evaluated by comparing outputs of the ANN with results of the conventional calculation method and acceptable in most fatigue design considerations.

Although pavement performance prediction has been extensively investigated in the past, models for predicting the cracking probability and for quantifying impacts of associated explanatory factors following pavement treatment, have not been adequately investigated in the past. In this paper the probability of alligator crack initiation following pavement treatments is modeled with the use of genetically optimized Neural Networks, The proposed methodological approach represents the actual (observed) relationships between of probability of crack initiation and the various design, traffic and weather factors as well as the different rehabilitation strategies. Data from the Long Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) Data Base and the Specific Pavement Study 5 (SPS-5) are used for model development. Results indicate that the proposed approach results in accurately predicting the probability of crack initiation following treatment; furthermore it provided information on the relationship between external factors and cracking probability that can help pavement managers in developing appropriate rehabilitation strategies.},

Fatigue tests were carried out by means of a disk on roller-type equipment. It was found that acicular structures are formed at an initial stage of the WEA formation process. Plastic deformations of spherodized carbides were caused by shear stress in the initial stage of this process as well. Additionally, micro voids were found near the interfaces. Furthermore, amorphous-like structures were found in the WEA. It was suggested that WEA formation is caused by the local plastic deformation of the material. The shear stress was caused by slipping between the roller and the disk. As a result, it was suggested that martensite forms an amorphous-like phase and then changes into a WEA. Cracks developed in the amorphous-like structure/the granular area interface in the WEA and in the Matrix/WEA interface.},

A smooth-particle-based evaluation method by the authors, applied here for the first time to visualize the sliding interface between the two layers of boundary lubricant, allowed the definition and calculation of a dimensionless normalized sliding resistance area, which was then related to the Derjaguin offset. This relationship excellently reflects the molecular surface coverage, which determines the physical condition of the lubricant, and can differentiate between some lubricant-specific frictional properties.},

The average volumetric coefficient of thermal expansion above T c was found to be 4.1 (1) × 10 −5 K −1 ; below T c it is considerably lower ({\textless} 1.8 × 10 −5 K −1 ) and varies greatly with temperature. The behaviour of the volume over the full temperature range of the experiment may be modelled by a third-order Gr{\"{u}}neisen approximation to the zero-pressure equation of state, combined with a magnetostrictive correction based on mean-field theory.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, The Author(s).For the successful development and application of novel lubricant additives, a full understanding of their tribological behaviour at the nanoscale is required, but this can be difficult to obtain experimentally. In this study, nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine the friction and wear reduction mechanisms of promising carbon nanoparticle friction modifier additives. Specifically, the friction and wear behaviour of carbon nanodiamonds (CNDs) and carbon nano-onions (CNOs) confined between $\alpha$-iron slabs is probed at a range of coverages, pressures, and sliding velocities. At high coverage and low pressure, the nanoparticles do not indent into the $\alpha$-iron slabs during sliding, leading to zero wear and a low friction coefficient. At low coverage and high pressure, the nanoparticles indent into, and plough through the slabs during sliding, leading to atomic-scale wear and a much higher friction coefficient. This contribution to the friction coefficient is well predicted by an expression developed for macroscopic indentation by Bowden and Tabor. Even at the highest pressures and lowest coverages simulated, both nanoparticles were able to maintain separation of the opposing slabs and reduce friction by approximately 75 {\%} compared to when no nanoparticle was present, which agrees well with experimental observations. CNO nanoparticles yielded a lower indentation (wear) depth and lower friction coefficients at equal coverage and pressure with respect to CND, making them more attractive friction modifier additives. Potential changes in behaviour on harder and softer surfaces are also discussed, together with the implications that these results have in terms of the application of the studied nanoparticles as lubricants additives.},

We then apply this methodology to four different metal-organic frameworks displaying a wine-rack structure: MIL-53(Al), MIL-47, MIL-122(In), and MIL-140A. From these results, we shed some light into the link between mechanical properties, geometric shape, and compliance of the framework of these porous solids.

It has been found that OMCTS fluid in tip-substrate contact has a strong tendency to form a layered structure, starting from n = 8 layers. The force profile obtained from simulation is qualitatively similar to those in contact mode AFM experiments. However, the bulk-like diffusion and rotation of OMCTS molecules underneath the AFM tip suggest that, under the tip-substrate confinement geometry, the layered OMCTS film cannot form a solidified structure except under n = 2 extreme contact-layer confinement.},

abstract = {Based on the benchmark created by the first principle calculations, the effectiveness of different empirical potential functions, including CVFF1, CVFF2, SW and REBO potentials, on describing the mechanical behavior of single layer MoS2 (SLMoS2) are evaluated. The mechanical properties including the elastic modulus E, Poisson's ratio nu, nonlinear elastic modulus D, failure stress and ultimate strain are considered. It is found that under a small deformation, the REBO and CVFF2 potentials can provide an effective description of the elastic behavior of SLMoS2; whereas under a large deformation, the SW potential gives a more accurate stress value and the CVFF2 potential can only predict the right value under biaxial tension. After modifying the cut-off distances in the REBO potential, the failure strain can be reasonably predicted by the REBO potential; whereas the failure stress will be overestimated by about 20-40{\%} for biaxial and uniaxial tension. The present study can provide help on accurately understanding the mechanical behavior of SLMoS2.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were performed under conditions of constant volume and temperature and of constant pressure and temperature to elucidate the structure activity relationships of a series of non-ionic surfactant molecules derived from vegetable fat and employed as friction modifiers in commercial engine oils. The simulations show the extent to which intermolecular hydrogen bonding is important in determining the stability of the monolayer formed by the surfactant molecules and show that mono-alkanoyl glyceride molecules are able to pack more efficiently, forming significantly more intermolecular hydrogen bonds and occupying approximately half the volume needed by di-alkanoyl glyceride molecules. Density profiles are presented which show significant mixing of the hydrophobic tail groups and a non-polar solvent. The distribution of torsion angles in the tail groups shows that the conformation is consistent with a liquid at finite temperature rather than a crystal structure. The measured friction coefficients of equimolar solutions of the glycerides show that the efficacy as friction modifiers varies in the order mono-, di- and the tri-oleyl glyceride, which is consistent with the efficacy of film formation predicted by the molecular dynamics calculations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The transition from ultra-thin lubrication to dry friction under high pressure and shear is studied using molecular dynamics: the quantity of lubricant in the confined film is progressively reduced toward solid-body contact. A quantized layer structure is observed for n-alkanes confined between smooth, wettable walls, featuring an alternation of well-layered, low friction configurations, and disordered ones, characterized by high friction, and heat generation. The molecular structure influences the ordering of the fluid and the resulting shear stress. In fact, Lennard-Jones fluids are characterized by low friction due to the absence of interlayer bridges, opposed to the always entangled states and high shear stresses for branched molecules. Surface geometry and wettability also affect the behavior of the confined lubricant. The presence of nanometer-scale roughness frustrates the ordering of the fluid molecules, leading to high friction states. Furthermore, local film breakdown can be observed when the asperities come into contact, with strong wall-wall interactions causing the maximum in shear stress. Finally, friction is limited to a small, constant value by the presence of smooth, non-wettable surfaces in the system due to the occurrence of wall slip.},

Mechanisms of fluid drag in turbulent flow and riblet-drag reduction theories from experiment and simulation are discussed. A review of riblet-performance studies is given, and optimal riblet geometries are defined. A survey of studies experimenting with riblet-topped shark-scale replicas is also given. A method for selecting optimal riblet dimensions based on fluid-flow characteristics is detailed, and current manufacturing techniques are outlined. Due to the presence of small amounts of mucus on the skin of a shark, it is expected that the localized application of hydrophobic materials will alter the flow field around the riblets in some way beneficial to the goals of increased drag reduction.},

It decreases with decreasing over(??, ??) and is over(??, ??)-independent at T greater than ???300 K. The activation parameters in simulation conditions have been obtained. The activation distance of ???(0.2-0.3)b is consistent with point-obstacle strengthening. However, the activation energy is only ???5kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and ???20kBT smaller than that realized in experimental conditions. This implies that the decline of ??c over the range 0 to ???400 K would occur over 0 to ???80 K in experiment, which is where C-edge dislocation effects would be influential. A few jumps of C occur in the core before dislocation unpinning at T ??? 800 K and give a small T-dependence of ??c. Core diffusion of C occurs by ?? 1 / 2 [1 1 over(1, ??)] jumps at 70.5?? to [1 1 1]. The diffusivity in the absence of applied stress is 4 ?? 10-9exp(-0.2 eV/kBT) m2/s compared with 1.9 ?? 10-7exp(-0.7 eV/kBT) m2/s for bulk diffusion of C in the same MD model. Hence, the edge dislocation provides a path for rapid diffusion of C, but net transport along the core can only occur by motion of the dislocation itself. ?? 2006 Acta Materialia Inc.},

Effect of interatomic potential on the calculated energy and structure of high-angle coincident site grain boundaries—I. (100) twist boundaries in aluminum


- Wolf, D. )



A new computer code is described which permits the investigation of the energy and structure of coincident-site lattice (CSL) grain boundaries in metals. As an improvement over computer programs used by other workers, the full second-derivative (force-constant) matrix associated with a given interatomic potential is applied for the iterative energy minimization. Using this extremely efficient and reliable relaxation procedure the effect of the form of the interatomic potential and its truncation radius on the predicted grain-boundary energy and structure is investigated. Six different potentials for aluminum, ranging from a Morse potential to a pseudopotential, are applied to the simulation of the energy and structure of (100) CSL twist boundaries with values of [summation operator], the inverse density of CSL sites, ranging between [summation operator] = 5 and [summation operator] = 73. It is found that not only do both the energy and structure of a given boundary vary greatly from one potential to another, but also that the relative energies of different boundaries, i.e. the boundary-energy vs misfit-angle curves, depend on the potential. In contrast to recent claims of Brokman and Balluffi, no {\{}{\&}{\}}quot;cusps{\{}{\&}{\}}quot; in these curves are found for potentials which ignore the charge-density oscillations. The two basic assumptions of the Brokman-Balluffi cusp model are found to be valid only for extremely simple potentials with very short cutoff radii. It is suggested that (i) charge-density oscillations may be important for predicting grain-boundary properties, and (ii) no obvious relationship exists between the grain-boundary geometry ([summation operator]) and the energy.

The complete modeling scheme is validated experimentally first using laboratory-controlled conditions, where the surface to-pography is varied as well as the operating conditions in the contact.

Tensorial analysis of the elastic constants reveal a highly anisotropic elastic behavior, some deformation directions exhibiting very low Young's modulus and shear modulus. This anisotropy can reach a 400:1 ratio between the most rigid and weakest directions, in stark contrast with the case of non-flexible MOFs such as MOF-5 and ZIF-8. In addition, we show that flexible MOFs can display extremely large negative linear compressibility (NLC). These results uncover the microscopic roots of stimuli-induced structural transitions in flexible MOFs, by linking the local elastic behavior of the material and its multistability.},

abstract = {In this article, we have investigated the anisotropic nature of thermal transport in molybdenum disulphide using molecular dynamics simulations. At first, a force field has been validated with respect to crystal structure and experimental vibrational spectra of MoS2. Thereafter, non-equilibrium MD simulations have been performed in two perpendicular directions (along as well as across the basal planes) to study thermal transport behavior. At room temperature, our results show an anisotropic factor of ???4 in the values of thermal conductivity along two studied directions, which is in good agreement with recent experiments on MoS2 thin films. However, the predicted values of thermal conductivity are about an order of magnitude higher with respect to experiments. The reasoning behind these differences has been discussed in terms of layer disorder and the large number of grain boundary interfaces in experimental thin films, which consisted of nano-crystalline MoS2 grains with a predominant parallel or perpendicular basal plane orientation. Incorporation of phonon scattering via structure disorder and boundary interfaces were identified as further directions for the model refinement. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

Additionally, the ester Lennard-Jones parameters were readjusted to reproduce experimental liquid bulk properties, densities, and heats of vaporization. This extension enabled the setup of LOPLS-AA parameters for GMO molecules. The properties of the lipid force field were tested for the liquid-crystalline phase of a GMO bilayer. The obtained area per lipid for GMO is in good agreement with experiment. Additionally, the lipid dynamics on the subpicosecond to the nanosecond time scale is in excellent agreement with results from time-of-flight (TOF) quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) experiments on a multilamellar monoolein system, enabling here for the first time the critical evaluation of the short-time dynamics obtained from a molecular dynamics simulation of a membrane system.},

The obtained analytical potential is suitable for simulations of H in bulk Fe as well as for modeling small FeH molecules, and it can be directly combined with our previously constructed potential for the stainless steel Fe-Cr-C system. This will allow simulations of, e.g., hydrocarbon molecule chemistry on steel surfaces.

abstract = {This paper deals with the bonding properties of 3d-, 4d-, and 5d-transition-metal carbides and nitrides. We consider NaCl-structure compounds, MC and MN, as well as carbides and nitrides with more complex crystal structures. The enthalpies of formation at zero temperature $\Delta$0H(0) of the MC and MN compounds are taken from previous ab initio linear-muffin-tin-oribtals calculations. We describe the structure as formed by a metal fcc lattice in which nonmetal atoms have been inserted at interstitial positions. $\Delta$0H(0) is divided into contributions from (i) formation of metallic fcc lattice, (ii) expansion of this lattice to the lattice spacing of the compound, and (iii) insertion of nonmetal atoms into the metal lattice. $\Delta$0H(0), plotted versus the position of M in the d series, shows a pronounced maximum for the Ti, Zr, and Hf carbides. In agreement with other work, we interpret this as due to the filling of bonding p-d hybridized states. The maximum in $\Delta$0H(0) is followed first by a decrease and then by an almost constant value. We interpret this as an effect of a gradual population of antibonding and nonbonding electronic states. Size effects, i.e., contribution (ii), are small for the 4d- and 5d-series compounds. $\Delta$0H(0) of MN is similar to that of MC, but the largest values occur for M=Sc,Y,La since N has one more valence electron than C. Bonding in the complex carbides and nitrides is given an analogous interpretation.},

abstract = {Shear localisation, in the form of discontinuities in the velocity profile, can occur in simulated fluid, associated with a limit to the shear stress. By modifying the thermostat, the occurrence of the plateau in the shear stress can be suppressed, resulting in a linear unconstrained velocity profile. The shear rate dependence of the traction coefficient leads to a limiting value of the traction coefficient even when the shear stress is unbounded. Simulations thus give insight into the molecular basis of the limiting shear stress behaviour in lubricants. The shear-induced positional ordering known as the "string phase" is found to occur in our hard-sphere model when the shear stress is limited, and where shear localisation also occurs, the string phase is restricted to the shear localisation regions.},

abstract = {The all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS-AA) force field is a popular force field for simulating biomolecules. However, the current OPLS parameters for hydrocarbons developed using short alkanes cannot reproduce the liquid properties of long alkanes in molecular dynamics simulations. Therefore, the extension of OPLS-AA to (phospho)lipid molecules required for the study of biological membranes was hampered in the past. Here, we optimized the OPLS-AA force field for both short and long hydrocarbons. Following the framework of the OPLS-AA parametrization, we refined the torsional parameters for hydrocarbons by fitting to the gas-phase ab initio energy profiles calculated at the accurate MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ theory level. Additionally, the depth of the Lennard-Jones potential for methylene hydrogen atoms was adjusted to reproduce the densities and the heats of vaporization of alkanes and alkenes of different lengths. Optimization of partial charges finally allowed to reproduce the gel-to-liquid-phase transition temperature for pentadecane and solvation free energies. It is shown that the optimized parameter set (L-OPLS) yields improved hydrocarbon diffusion coefficients, viscosities, and gauche?trans ratios. Moreover, its applicability for lipid bilayer simulations is shown for a GMO bilayer in its liquid-crystalline phase.},

abstract = {Using molecular mechanics (or dynamics) simulations, three different approaches, including the targeted molecular mechanics, four-point bending and nanotube methods, are employed to investigate the bending response of single layer MoS2 (SLMoS2), among which four-point bending is the most accurate approach to determine the bending stiffness according to the continuum theory. It is found that when the bending curvature radius is large enough (e.g. {\textgreater}4 nm), three approaches will give the same bending stiffness of SLMoS2 and the bending behavior is isotropic for SLMoS2, whereas the nanotube method with small tubes (e.g. {\textless}4 nm) cannot give the correct bending stiffness. Compared with the reported result from the MoS2 nanotube calculated by density functional theory, the revised Stillinger-Weber (SW) and reactive empirical bond-order (REBO) potentials can give the reasonable bending stiffness of SLMoS2 (8.7-13.4 eV) as well as the effective deformed conformation. In addition, since the Mo-S bond deformation of SLMoS2 under bending is similar to that under in-plane tension/compression, the continuum bending theory can quite accurately predict the bending stiffness of SLMoS2 if a reasonable thickness of SLMoS2 is given. For SLMoS2, the reasonable thickness should be larger than the distance between its two S atomic planes and lower than the distance between two Mo atomic planes of bulk MoS2 crystal, e.g. 0.375-0.445 nm.},

The potential parameters are fitted to an experimentally-obtained phonon spectrum, and the resulting empirical potential provides a good description for the energy gap and the crossover in the phonon spectrum. Using this potential, we perform classical molecular dynamics simulations to study chirality, size, and strain effects on the Young's modulus and the thermal conductivity of SLMoS2. We demonstrate the importance of the free edges on the mechanical and thermal properties of SLMoS2 nanoribbons. Specifically, while edge effects are found to reduce the Young's modulus of SLMoS2 nanoribbons, the free edges also reduce the thermal stability of SLMoS2 nanoribbons, which may induce melting well below the bulk melt temperature. Finally, uniaxial strain is found to efficiently manipulate the thermal conductivity of infinite, periodic SLMoS2.},

Using Molecular dynamics simulations, we developed MoS2 force field parameters to reproduce the experimentally determined water contact angle of the MoS2nanosheet and then predicted the slip-length of water that has not been measured in experiment yet. Simulation results suggest that the MoS2nanosheet is a hydrophobic and low-friction surface, despite its seemingly significant charges of surface atoms and relatively strong strength of van der Waals potentials.

abstract = {Hydrogen embrittlement in metals has posed a serious obstacle to designing strong and reliable structural materials for many decades, and predictive physical mechanisms still do not exist. Here, a new H embrittlement mechanism operating at the atomic scale in $\alpha$-iron is demonstrated. Direct molecular dynamics simulations reveal a ductile-to-brittle transition caused by the suppression of dislocation emission at the crack tip due to aggregation of H, which then permits brittle-cleavage failure followed by slow crack growth. The atomistic embrittlement mechanism is then connected to material states and loading conditions through a kinetic model for H delivery to the crack-tip region. Parameter-free predictions of embrittlement thresholds in Fe-based steels over a range of H concentrations, mechanical loading rates and H diffusion rates are found to be in excellent agreement with experiments. This work provides a mechanistic, predictive framework for interpreting experiments, designing structural components and guiding the design of embrittlement-resistant materials.},

The role of microstructure in susceptibility to hydrogen trapping is evaluated using a numerical thermokinetic simulation approach. The simulation scheme is applied to evaluate variations in dislocation density and grain size in pure ferritic iron, ferritic and martensitic low alloy steels during cooling and ferritic steels under deformation. Additionally, variations in NbC nanoprecipitates in low alloy tempered martensitic steel, and coherent and incoherent TiC precipitates in low alloy steels were evaluated. These simulations were conducted to quantify the influence of such features on the trapping efficiency of interstitial hydrogen. To simulate the diffusion process in a complex microstructure, a mean field approach is applied. Modelling approaches adopting physically based formulations for the calculation of the trapping-affected concentration of hydrogen in the lattice are suggested, adopted in the present calculations and validated for a wide range of experimental and microstructural conditions. The combination of thermokinetic simulations with hydrogen trapping behaviours is the first of its kind and presents a means to incorporate the effects of various microstructural features, with respect to hydrogen migration and trapping, in the design of hydrogen embrittlement resistant steels.},

To this end, a recent van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF-CX) is employed, which is shown to yield excellent agreement with reference data for the structural parameters. The calculated in-plane thermal conductivity compares well with experimental room temperature values, when phonon-phonon and isotopic scattering are included. To explain the behavior over the entire available temperature range one must, however, include additional (temperature independent) scattering mechanisms that limit the mean free path. Generally, the primary heat carrying modes have mean free paths of {\$}1\backslash,\backslashmu\backslashtext{\{}m{\}}{\$} or more, which makes these materials very susceptible to structural defects. The conductivity of Mo and W-based TMDs is primarily determined by the chalcogenide species and increases in the order Te-Se-S. While for the tellurides and selenides the transition metal element has a negligible effect, the conductivity of WS{\$}{\_}2{\$} is notably higher than for MoS{\$}{\_}2{\$}, which can be traced to the much larger phonon band gap of the former.

There are, however, no validated thermodynamic data to enable phase equilibria to be estimated when silicon is present in cementite. The formation energies of Fe3C, (Fe11 SiFe 4 c) C4 and (Fe11 SiFe 8 d) C4 have therefore been estimated using first-principles calculations based on the total energy all-electron full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave method within the generalized gradient approximation to density functional theory. The ground state properties such as lattice constants and bulk moduli have also been calculated. The calculations show that (Fe11 SiFe 4 c) C4 and (Fe11 SiFe 8 d) C4 have about 52.06 kJ mol-1 and 37.17 kJ mol-1 greater formation energy, respectively, than Fe3C. The formation energy for hypothetical cementite Si3C has also been calculated to be about 256 kJ mol-1. Silicon substitution significantly reduces the magnetic moments at the Fe(4c) site for both (Fe11 SiFe 4 c) C4 and (Fe11 SiFe 8 d) C4, irrespective of the Si substitution sites. The calculated electronic structures indicate that the magnetic moment reduction at the Fe(4c) site by the Si substitution at 4c site is indirect through the neighboring carbon atom, whereas at the 8d site it is direct. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present combined force curve and conduction atomic force microscopy (AFM) data for the linear alkanes CnH2n+2 (n = 10, 12, 14, 16) confined between a gold-coated AFM tip and a graphite surface. Solvation layering is observed in the force curves for all liquids, and conduction AFM is used to study in detail the removal of the confined (mono)layer closest to the graphite surface. The squeeze-out behavior of the monolayer can be very different depending upon the temperature. Below the monolayer melting transition temperatures the molecules are in an ordered state on the graphite surface, and fast and complete removal of the confined molecules is observed. However, above the melting transition temperature the molecules are in a disordered state, and even at large applied pressure a few liquid molecules are trapped within the tip–sample contact zone. These findings are similar to a previous study for branched alkanes [Gosvami Phys. Rev. Lett. 2008, 100, 076101], but the observation for the linear alkane homologue series demonstrates clearly the dependence of the squeeze-out and trapping on the state of the confined material.},

@article{Nicolini2016,
abstract = {In recent years, a lot of effort has been devoted to the investigation of the properties of molybdenum disulfide by using both experimental and theoretical/computational techniques. In fact MoS2 applications include catalysis, nanoelectronics and lubrication. Among other things, this is also reflected in the number of empirical force fields for MoS2 that have been developed and proposed in literature. However, as in any classical molecular dynamics simulations, the accuracy of the calculated properties strongly depends on the reliability of the empirical potential employed. In this article we review critically all the available force fields for MoS2, focusing on the calculation of the properties that are more involved in determining the tribological behavior. On the basis of the presented results, we provide recommendations for a proper choice of the empirical potentials to use in a computational study, as well as indications for future refinements of the existing force fields.},

@article{Stenzel2011,
abstract = {In October 2009 the European Commission decided that fuel consumption by aviation and shipping has to be reduced by 10{\%} and 20{\%} respectively by 2020. A significant contribution to this challenging goal could be a coating that reduces drag. For about 20 years it has been known that special microstructures ("riblets") can lower drag by up to 10{\%}. A new process for the production of such microstructured coatings on large surfaces is presented in this article. This process allows coating application, embossing, and partial curing in a single step. The coating material consists of VOC-free nanocomposites that give the coating the necessary abrasion resistance and weathering stability. Drag measurements have been carried out in a ship model basin and in a wind-tunnel respectively. In these experiments, smooth coatings were compared to riblet-structured coatings. These structures were adapted to the flow-parameters of the fluid. A surface-drag reduction of 5.2{\%} for a torpedo-shaped specimen was measured in a large hydrodynamic and cavitation tunnel. In a wind-tunnel experiment a reduction of the total drag of a wing-profile by 6.2{\%} was measured. Both experiments indicate the high potential for fuel savings in the transportation sector. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Hydrogen trap state by cementite in ferrite was investigated by ab-initio calculations. The calculated trap energy at cementite interstitial was 33 kJ/mol and that at the interface of cementite/ferrite was 39 kJ/mol. The calculated activation energy of the migration over the stable interstitial sites is 55 kJ/mol. Considering calculated zero point vibration energy, the trap energy at cementite interstitial becomes 41 kJ/mol and the activation energy becomes at least 59 kJ/mol. The low temperature peak at about 400 K in Thermal Desorption Spectrum (TDS) of cementite reported by other researchers is considered to correspond to the trap site at the cementite/ferrite interface. Since the interstitial trap site in cementite is not effective because of the high diffusion barrier at low temperature, the higher temperature peak at about 500 K in the TDS is considered to correspond to the migration energy from the defects such as grain boundaries in cementite introduced by deformation},

abstract = {The mechanical behaviour of nanocrystalline materials (that is, polycrystals with a grain size of less than 100 nm) remains controversial. Although it is commonly accepted that the intrinsic deformation behaviour of these materials arises from the interplay between dislocation and grain-boundary processes, little is known about the specific deformation mechanisms. Here we use large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations to elucidate this intricate interplay during room-temperature plastic deformation of model nanocrystalline Al microstructures. We demonstrate that, in contrast to coarse-grained Al, mechanical twinning may play an important role in the deformation behaviour of nanocrystalline Al. Our results illustrate that this type of simulation has now advanced to a level where it provides a powerful new tool for elucidating and quantifying--in a degree of detail not possible experimentally--the atomic-level mechanisms controlling the complex dislocation and grain-boundary processes in heavily deformed materials with a submicrometre grain size.},

abstract = {Models for line defects in grain boundaries are considered. The structures of grain boundary dislocations (GBD's) and ledges are examined and line defects which correspond to either pure GBD's, pure grain boundary ledges or else defects possessing both dislocation and ledge character are distinguished. The concept of intrinsic grain boundary dislocations (IGBD's) is described, and circuits are denned which yield the Burgers vectors of both GBD's and IGBD's. Two distinct types of circuits are found to be useful and are presented. Virtual grain boundary dislocations (VGBD's) are also considered. What have been called VGBD's are shown in some cases to be true GBD's. In other cases, defects exist which could logically be termed VGBD's, but these can often alternatively be regarded as the result of the superposition of GBD's and IGBD's. GBD's formed in grain boundary cutting or impingement processes are found to be identical to secondary GBD's in boundaries of near-coincidence orientation. Generalized secondary GBD's are found to constitute an intermediate representation between the Frank model and the surface dislocation model.},

In this extension, all functions are analytic and computationally simple. The basic equations of the method are developed and applied to 26 elements: ten fcc, ten bcc, three diamond cubic, and three gaseous materials. The materials modeled include metals, semiconductors, and diatomic gases, all of which exhibit different types of bonding. Properties of these materials, including equation of state, elastic moduli, structural energies and lattice constants, simple defects, and surfaces, are calculated. The formalism for applying the method to combinations of these elements is developed and applied to the calculation of dilute heats of solution. In all cases, comparison is made to experiment or higher-level calculations when possible.},

abstract = {A molecular-dynamics simulation method is described that permits space-filling,
fully dense three-dimensional nanocrystalline materials to be grown
by crystallization from the melt. The method is illustrated by computer
synthesis of an eight-grain polycrystal of Cu with a grain size of
43 {\AA}. At the beginning of the simulation, eight small pre-oriented
single-crystal seeds are embedded in the melt which is subsequently
cooled below the melting point to enable crystal growth under an
applied external pressure. The fully relaxed nanocrystalline material
contains large perfect-crystal regions separated by well-defined
grain boundaries, most of which have approximately the same width
and energy. In spite of the rather small number of grains in the
simulation cell, the thermal expansion of the material is practically
isotropic, and almost identical to that of the perfect crystal. The
elastic moduli are also almost isotropic and are somewhat lower than
in the coarse-grained material. The material exhibits a low-temperature
anomaly in the specific heat.},

This fundamental behavior, along with an abnormally high intrinsic stacking fault energy and a different orientation dependence on pressure hardening, are traced to the directional nature of its bonding. By a comparative analysis of ion relaxations and valence charge redistributions in aluminum and copper, we arrive at contrasting descriptions of bonding characteristics in these two metals that can explain their relative strength and deformation behavior.},

We find that these grain boundary atoms display a lack of a second peak in the pair distribution function by virtue of their classification, and find further that such a class of atoms cannot be easily selected via an energy criterion. Despite being positionally disordered, atomic visualization demonstrates that even these atoms display can a certain degree of regularity by belonging to, for example, localized regions of miss fit. This confirms once again, that in terms of the degree of disorder, the nature of the nanocrystalline grain boundary network is not fundamentally different from that of the polycrystalline regime.},

abstract = {A review of geometric criteria for low interfacial energy which have been proposed in the literature is given. These include (i) low reciprocal volume density of coincidence sites; (ii) high planar density of coincidence sites, GAMMA ; (iii) high GAMMA at constant interplanar spacing, d; (iv) large d; and (v) high density of locked-in rows of atoms. These criteria are tested against experimental results which include measurements of: (a) interfacial energy; (b) rotations of crystallites on flat crystal substrates; (c) boundary faceting; (d) boundary dissociation; and (e) observations of grain boundary dislocations. No support for the general usefulness of criteria (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) is found. In all cases, results violating these criteria are found or else it is demonstrated that their range of validity is undefined, hence their predictive power is highly limited. Criterion (iii) applies for a limited number of cases involving metal/metal or ionic/ionic interfaces but fails for metal/ionic interfaces. It is concluded that no general and useful criterion for low energy can be enshrined in a simple geometric framework. Any understanding of the variations of interfacial energy must take account of the atomic structure and bonding at the interface.},

annote = {The zero-temperature energies and equilibrium volume expansions of point-defect free grain boundaries (GBs) on the two densest planes of f.c.c. Cu have been determined using an Embedded Atom Method (EAM) and a Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. It is found that the energies and volume expansions of the (100) boundaries are about 2-3 times larger than those of the (111) boundaries. This correlation between the GB energy and the densest planes is analyzed in terms of the structural disorder in the interface region. A close correlation between large volume expansion and high GB energy is observed. Since both potentials yield qualitatively very similar results it is concluded that the short-range repulsion between atoms is the dominating contribution to the energy in the GB region and that therefore, electronic effects arising from a local volume dependence of the interatomic interactions are relatively unimportant.},

abstract = {Modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potentials for fcc elements Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Al, and Pb have been newly developed using the original first nearest-neighbor MEAM and the recently developed second nearest-neighbor MEAM formalisms. It was found that the original MEAM potentials for fcc elements show some critical shortcomings such as structural instability and incorrect surface reconstructions on (100), (110), and/or (111) surfaces. The newly developed MEAM potentials solve most of the problems and describe the bulk properties (elastic constants, structural energy differences), point defect properties (vacancy and interstitial formation energy and formation volume, activation energy of vacancy diffusion), planar defect properties (stacking fault energy, surface energy, surface relaxation and reconstruction), and thermal properties (thermal expansion coefficients, specific heat, melting point, heat of melting) of the fcc elements considered, in good agreement with relevant experimental information. It has been shown that in the MEAM the degree of many-body screening (C-min) is an important material property and that structural stability at finite temperatures should be included as a checkpoint during development of semiempirical potentials.},

abstract = {The grain boundaries (GB) in nanocrystalline Pd with high-energy bicrystalline GB are compared. The appearance upon annealing or growth from the melt of a highly disordered GB of uniform thickness and energy is driven by lowering of the GB energy and represents a thermodynamic-equilibrium phenomenon. The random misorientations between the grains give rise to GBs having both tilt and twist components and a relatively high energy. The main difference between the GBs in a coarse-grained and a nanocrystalline microstructure lie in their respective GB energy distribution. Coarse-grained materials exhibit a broad, more equilibrated GB-energy distribution while a nanocrystalline microstructure with random grain orientations contain only high-energy GBs.},

annote = { The origin of the Peierls model and its relation to that of Frenkel and Kontorova are described. Within this model there are three essentially different formulae for the stress required to move a dislocation rigidly through a perfect lattice, associated with the names of Peierls, Nabarro and Huntington. There are also three distinct approaches to experimental estimates of the Peierls stress, depending on the Bordoni internal friction peak, the flow stress at low temperatures and Harper-Dorn creep. The results in the case of close-packed metals can be reconciled with the aid of ideas due to Benoit et al. and to Schoeck. The analytical elegance of Peierls{\&}{\#}039;s solution depends on the assumption of a sinusoidal law of force across the glide plane. This is physically unrealistic. Foreman et al. and others have obtained interesting results using other laws of force, while still operating in the framework of the Peierls model. The locking-unlocking model extends the ideas to the case in which the dislocation core has two mechanically stable configurations.},

Here the stiffness and mobility are computed using an analysis of fluctuations in the grain boundary position during molecular dynamics simulations. This work represents the first determination of grain boundary stiffness for a realistic three-dimensional system. The results indicate that the boundary stiffness for a given boundary plane has a strong dependence on the direction of the boundary distortion. The mobility deduced is comparable with that determined in previous computer simulation studies. The advantages and limitations of the fluctuation approach are discussed. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen great advances in our ability to predict crystal structures from first principles. However, previous algorithms have focused on the prediction of bulk crystal structures, where the global minimum is the target. Here, we present a general atomistic approach to simulate in multicomponent systems the structures and free energies of grain boundaries and heterophase interfaces with fixed stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric compositions. The approach combines a new genetic algorithm using empirical interatomic potentials to explore the configurational phase space of boundaries, and thereafter refining structures and free energies with first-principles electronic structure methods. We introduce a structural order parameter to bias the genetic algorithm search away from the global minimum (which would be bulk crystal), while not favouring any particular structure types, unless they lower the energy. We demonstrate the power and efficiency of the algorithm by considering non-stoichiometric grain boundaries in a ternary oxide, SrTiO(3).},

Lattice images have been produced by including the objective-aperture superlattice spots associated with the ordered distribution of vacancies in the interstitial carbon sublattice of these substiochiometric compounds: 'perfectly' ordered structures have been imaged, and a direct discussion of the experimental micrographs is made in terms of positions of the vacancy-containing columns. This HREM study will soon be extended to the investigation of various kinds of planar defects within differently annealed specimens.},

@book{citeulike:493765,
abstract = {This is the greatly revised and greatly expanded Second Edition of the hugely
popular Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing. The product of a
unique collaboration among four leading scientists in academic research and
industry Numerical Recipes is a complete text and reference book on scientific
computing. In a self-contained manner it proceeds from mathematical and
theoretical considerations to actual practical computer routines. With over
100 new routines bringing the total to well over 300, plus upgraded versions
of the original routines, this new edition remains the most practical,
comprehensive handbook of scientific computing available today. Highlights of
the new material include: -A new chapter on integral equations and inverse
methods -Multigrid and other methods for solving partial differential
equations -Improved random number routines - Wavelet transforms -The
statistical bootstrap method -A new chapter on "less-numerical" algorithms
including compression coding and arbitrary precision arithmetic. The book
retains the informal easy-to-read style that made the first edition so
popular, while introducing some more advanced topics. It is an ideal textbook
for scientists and engineers and an indispensable reference for anyone who
works in scientific computing. The Second Edition is availabe in FORTRAN, the
traditional language for numerical calculations and in the increasingly
popular C language.},

@misc{Monnet2010,
abstract = {Given the time and length scales in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of dislocation-defect interactions, quantitative MD results cannot be used directly in larger scale simulations or compared directly with experiment. A method to extract fundamental quantities from MD simulations is proposed here. The first quantity is a critical stress defined to characterise the obstacle resistance. This mesoscopic parameter, rather than the obstacle 'strength' designed for a point obstacle, is to be used for an obstacle of finite size. At finite temperature, our analyses of MD simulations allow the activation energy to be determined as a function of temperature. The results confirm the proportionality between activation energy and temperature that is frequently observed by experiment. By coupling the data for the activation energy and the critical stress as functions of temperature, we show how the activation energy can be deduced at a given value of the critical stress.},

abstract = {The second nearest-neighbor modified embedded atom method (MEAM) [Phys. Rev. B 62, 8564 (2000)], developed in order to solve problems of the original first nearest-neighbor MEAM on bcc metals, has now been applied to all bcc transition metals, Fe, Cr, Mo, W, V, Nb, and Ta. The potential parameters could be determined empirically by fitting to (partial derivativeB/partial derivativeP), elastic constants, structural energy differences among bcc, fcc and hcp structures, vacancy-formation energy, and surface energy. Various physical properties of individual elements, including elastic constants, structural properties, point-defect properties, surface properties, and thermal properties were calculated and compared with experiments or high level calculations so that the reliability of the present empirical atomic-potential formalism can be evaluated, It is shown that the present potentials reasonably reproduce nonfitted properties of the bcc transition metals, as well as the fitted properties. The effect of the size of radial cutoff distance on the calculation and the compatibility with the original first nearest-neighbor MEAM that has been successful for fcc, hcp, and other structures are also discussed.},

@article{Shibata2001,
abstract = {Cubic stabilized zirconia bicrystals with [110] symmetric tilt grain boundaries were fabricated by diffusion bonding of two single crystals with the composition of ZrO2-9.6mol{\%}Y2O3. The structures of symmetric tilt small angle grain boundary and two types of symmetric tilt sigma3 grain boundaries with different grain boundary planes were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM) observations clarified that the [110] small angle tilt grain boundary consists of periodic array of b = a/2[110] type edge dislocations. This result is consistent with Frank's dislocation model for small angle grain boundary. HREM observation also revealed that the 70.5 degrees sigma3 grain boundary shows atomically coherent grain boundary structure with the boundary plane of [111], while the 109.5 degrees sigma3 grain boundary accompanies grain boundary facets taking [111]/[115] asymmetric grain boundary plane. Because of the very low surface energy of [111] plane and/or high lattice matching of [111] and [115] type planes, the grain boundary faceting may be preferred in spite of increasing grain boundary area to about 6{\%}. TEM-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses were performed on both sigma3 grain boundaries, and the segregation of yttrium ions to the boundaries was detected in both cases. The amount of segregation is about the same in both sigma3 boundaries. It can be concluded that the segregation of yttrium ions to sigma3 grain boundary exists in cubic zirconia.},

abstract = {A method for solving small-strain plasticity problems with plastic flow represented by the collective motion of a large number of discrete dislocations is presented. The dislocations are modelled as line defects in a linear elastic medium. At each instant, superposition is used to represent the solution in terms of the infinite-medium solution for the discrete dislocations and a complementary solution that enforces the boundary conditions on the finite body. The complementary solution is nonsingular and is obtained from a finite-element solution of a linear elastic boundary value problem. The lattice resistance to dislocation motion, dislocation nucleation and annihilation are incorporated into the formulation through a set of constitutive rules. Obstacles leading to possible dislocation pile-ups are also accounted for. The deformation history is calculated in a linear incremental manner. Plane-strain boundary value problems are solved for a solid having edge dislocations on parallel slip planes. Monophase and composite materials subject to simple shear parallel to the slip plane are analysed. Typically, a peak in the shear stress versus shear strain curve is found, after which the stress falls to a plateau at which the material deforms steadily. The plateau is associated with the localization of dislocation activity on more or less isolated systems. The results for composite materials are compared with solutions for a phenomenological continuum slip characterization of plastic flow.},

abstract = {Abstract The behaviour of copper atoms in dilute solution in $\alpha$-iron is important for the microstructural changes that occur in ferritic pressure vessel steels under fastneutron irradiation. To investigate the properties of atomic defects that control this behaviour, a set of many-body interatomic potentials has been developed for the Fe—Cu system. The procedures employed, including modifications to ensure suitability for simulating atomic collisions at high energy, are described. The effect of copper on the lattice parameter of iron in the new model is in good agreement with experiment. The phonon properties of the pure crystals and, in particular, the influence of the instability of the metastable, bcc phase of copper that precipitates during irradiation are discussed. The properties of point defects have been investigated. It is found that the vacancy has lower formation and migration energy in bcc copper than in $\alpha$-iron, and the self-interstitial atom has very low formation energy in this phase of coppe...},

abstract = {We have performed an ab initio study of the surface energy and the work function for six closepacked surfaces of 40 elemental metals by means of a Green's-function technique, based on the linear-muon-tin-orbitals method within the tight-binding and atomic-sphere approximations. The results are in excellent agreement with a recent full-potential, all-electron, slab-supercell calculation of surface energies and work functions for the 4d metals. The present calculations explain the trend exhibited by the surface energies of the alkali, alkaline earth, divalent rare-earth, 3d, 4d, and 5d transition and noble metals, as derived from the surface tension of liquid metals. In addition, they give work functions which agree with the limited experimental data obtained from single crystals to within 15', and explain the smooth behavior of the experimental work functions of polycrystalline samples as a function of atomic number. It is argued that the surface energies and work functions calculated by present day ab initio methods are at least as accurate as the experimental values.},

@article{Didziulis2003,
abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on stoichiometric, high-symmetry clusters have been performed to model the (100) and (111) surface electronic structure and bonding properties of titanium carbide (TiC), vanadium carbide (VC), and titanium nitride (TiN). The interactions of ideal surface sites on these clusters with three adsorbates, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and the oxygen atom, have been pursued theoretically to compare with experimental studies. New experimental results using valence band photoemission of the interaction of O(2) with TiC and VC are presented, and comparisons to previously published experimental studies of CO and NH(3) chemistry are provided. In general, we find that the electronic structure of the bare clusters is entirely consistent with published valence band photoemission work and with straightforward molecular orbital theory. Specifically, V(9)C(9) and Ti(9)N(9) clusters used to model the nonpolar (100) surface possess nine electrons in virtually pure metal 3d orbitals, while Ti(9)C(9) has no occupation of similar orbitals. The covalent mixing of the valence bonding levels for both VC and TiC is very high, containing virtually 50{\%} carbon and 50{\%} metal character. As expected, the predicted mixing for the Ti(9)N(9) cluster is somewhat less. The Ti(8)C(8) and Ti(13)C(13) clusters used to model the TiC(111) surface accurately predict the presence of Ti 3d-based surface states in the region of the highest occupied levels. The bonding of the adsorbate species depends critically on the unique electronic structure features present in the three different materials. CO bonds more strongly with the V(9)C(9) and Ti(9)N(9) clusters than with Ti(9)C(9) as the added metal electron density enables an important pi-back-bonding interaction, as has been observed experimentally. NH(3) bonding with Ti(9)N(9) is predicted to be somewhat enhanced relative to VC and TiC due to greater Coulombic interactions on the nitride. Finally, the interaction with oxygen is predicted to be stronger with the carbon atom of Ti(9)C(9) and with the metal atom for both V(9)C(9) and Ti(9)N(9). In sum, these results are consistent with labeling TiC(100) as effectively having a d(0) electron configuration, while VC- and TiN(100) can be considered to be d(1) species to explain surface chemical properties.},

We study systematically the effect of the morphology (dispersed or aggregated particles) and of the effective particle-particle interactions. In addition, we have experimented by replacing the standard harmonic DPD bonds with other potential functions, conceived to deal with the finite extensibility of the polymer chains and the possibility of a slow equilibrium between strongly and weakly adsorbed chains at the rubber-filler interface. The simulation results shed some light on the basic mechanisms of rubber reinforcement, including the nonlinearity and history dependence commonly known as "Payne effect" and "Mullins effect."},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the coating processes of refractory carbides and nitrides. Coatings of refractory carbides and nitrides have great industrial importance with a wide range of applications in semiconductors and other electronic components, in cutting tools, gas-turbine vanes and blades, precision bearings, punch sets, extruders, prostheses, and many other products. The surface of a material may be exposed to wear, corrosion, radiation, electrical or magnetic fields, and other phenomena and hence, it must have the ability to withstand these environments. This can be accomplished by coating the base material to obtain a composite in which the surface properties may be considerably different from those of the substrate. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and physical vapor deposition (PVD) belong to the class of vapor-transfer processes, which are atomistic in nature—that is, the deposition species are atoms or molecules or a combination of these. The coatings are also commonly known as thin-films when their thickness is less than 10 $\mu$m. {\{}CVD{\}} is a versatile process that is well adapted to the production of all the refractory carbides and nitrides, not only as coatings but also as powders, bulk/monolithic components, and fibers. It may be defined as the deposition of a solid on a heated surface from a chemical reaction in the vapor phase. },

In this work, the interaction parameter in DPD simulation, related to the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter $\chi$, is estimated by the calculation of mixing energy for each pair of components in molecular dynamics simulation. Volume fraction and mixing methods clearly affect the equilibrated structure. Even if the volume fraction is different, micro-structures are similar when the equilibrated structures are different. Unlike the blend system, where no relationship exists between the micro-structure and the equilibrated structure, in the di-block copolymer system, the micro-structure and equilibrated structure have specific relationships.},

abstract = {The elastic properties and thermal expansion of TIC, TiN, VC and VN are calculated by means of a precise first-principles electronic structure method. The single-crystal elastic constants are derived from the total energies of distorted structures. For the thermal expansion, the contribution of electronic states is determined within a free-electron model utilizing the density of states at the Fermi energy of the actual materials. The contribution of lattice vibrations to the thermal properties is modelled by Debye's approximation for phonon dispersion. Anharmonic effects are included via Griineisen's theory requiring the volume dependence of the Debye temperature. For the calculation of the Gruneisen parameter, volume- and pressure-dependent single-crystal elastic constants are needed. Since in reality refractory compounds always contain vacancies, the influence of vacancies is studied for vanadium carbides by a supercell of composition VCo 75. It is found that vacancies significantly increase the thermal expansion coefficient, in particular at higher temperatures. Because of the modelling procedure, third derivatives of first-principles total energies are needed, which requires a high-quality method as well as a thorough application of it. The accuracy of the calculated values as well as their agreement with the rather sparse experimental data is discussed.},

Simulated as a membrane patch, the DPD model is in excellent agreement with experimental data for both the area expansion modulus and the scaling of hydrophobic core thickness with molecular weight. Rupture simulations of polymer vesicles, or "polymersomes", are presented to illustrate the system sizes feasible with DPD. The results should provide guidance for theoretical derivations of scaling laws and also illustrate how spherical polymer vesicles might be studied in simulation.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reveals the properties of covalent nitrides—boron nitride, aluminum nitrides, and silicon nitride—and provides a summary of the fabrication processes and applications of these compounds. The refractory covalent nitrides have remarkable properties and are industrial materials of major importance, produced on a large scale in the form of powders, monolithic shapes, and coatings. The three covalent nitrides are low-density materials with melting points, which are higher than those of their parent elements—boron, aluminum, and silicon. Of the three, boron nitride has the highest melting point and is more refractory than boron carbide. On the other hand, silicon nitride is not as refractory as silicon carbide. The thermal conductivity of the covalent nitrides decreases with increasing temperature. Thermal expansion of the covalent nitrides is low and, like that of the covalent carbides, increases with increasing temperature. This increase is not entirely linear and is slightly more rapid at high temperature. The covalent nitrides are excellent electrical insulators. Their electrons are strongly and covalently bonded to the nucleus and are not available for metallic bonding. },

We demonstrate that the corresponding equations of motion lead to the relevant ensembles and propose an appropriate scheme of integration. After having identified a suitable set of parameters for the approach, we demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by applying it to two different systems, a simple isotropic fluid and an anisotropic fluid lipid-bilayer membrane in water. Results are presented for, respectively, isothermal bulk compressibility, tracer diffusion coefficient, lipid head-group area, and isothermal area compressibility. We find that our Langevin piston approach leads to improvements over other approaches in terms of faster equilibration and shorter correlation times of various system variables.},

abstract = {Employing the density functional theory, we investigate the tensile and fracture processes of the Al/TiN(0 0 1) interface. The simulation presents directly the strain-stress relationship, the ideal tensile strength and the process of bond breaking of the system. Through the analysis of deformation, we find that the softer Al layers deform larger than the harder TiN layers during the tensile process. And fracture occurs between the interface and the sub-interface Al layers. In addition, the results show that during the tensile process, the ripple of the interfacial TiN layer decreases gradually with the increment of the strain. Charge transfer was detected from the Al to TiN layers near the interface area during the tensile process by means of charge density and density of states analyses. The charge transfer affects the fracture process. Compared to our previous study of the Al/TiN(1 1 1) interface, the Al/TiN(0 0 1) interface has smaller work of adhesion and larger tensile strength than the Al/TiN(1 1 1) interface. Our investigation shows that the fractures of the Al/TiN(0 0 1) and (1 1 1) interface systems both happen in the Al layers near the interface. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Phung2013,
abstract = {Because of its excellent properties in nanotechnology applications, atomic layer deposition of ruthenium (Ru) has been the subject of numerous experimental studies. Recently, two different Ru precursors were compared for plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) of Ru, and their reactivity was found to be different. Inhibition was observed for bis(ethylcyclopentadienyl)ruthenium (Ru(EtCp)2), while nearly linear growth behavior was observed for (methylcyclopentadienyl-pyrrolyl)ruthenium (Ru- (MeCp)Py). To understand this difference in reactivity, we investigate the adsorption of RuCp2 and RuCpPy (i.e., without substituents) on a TiN surface using calculations based on periodic boundary conditions density functional theory (DFT) combined with experiments based on Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The calculations demonstrate that the RuCpPy precursor chemisorbs on the TiN(100) surface while the RuCp2 precursor only physisorbs. We propose a reaction mechanism for the chemisorption of RuCpPy. The area density of the calculated RuCpPy surface species is compared with the experimental values from RBS. The impact of a H-plasma is also investigated. The DFT calculations and experimental results from RBS provide insight into the adsorption processes of the RuCpPy and RuCp2 precursors on the TiN(100) surface.},

@article{Trofimov2005,
abstract = {Dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) is a mesoscopic simulation method for studying hydrodynamic behavior of complex fluids. Ideally, a mesoscopic model should correctly represent the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of a real system beyond certain length and time scales. Traditionally defined DPD quite successfully mimics hydrodynamics but is not flexible enough to accurately describe the thermodynamics of a real system. The so-called multibody DPD (MDPD) is a pragmatic extension of the classical DPD that allows one to prescribe the thermodynamic behavior of a system with only a small performance impact. In an earlier paper [S. Y. Trofimov, E. L. F. Nies, and M. A. J. Michels, J. Chem. Phys. 117, 9383 (2002)] we much improved the accuracy of the MDPD model for strongly nonideal systems, which are of most practical interest. The ability to correctly reproduce the equation of state of realistic systems in turn makes simulations at constant pressure sensible and useful. This situation of constant-pressure conditions is very common in experimental studies of (soft) condensed matter but has so far remained unexplored with the traditional DPD. Here, as a proof of concept, we integrate a modified version of the Andersen barostat into our improved MDPD model and make an evaluation of the performance of the new model on a set of single- and multicomponent systems. The modification of the barostat suppresses the "unphysical" volume oscillations after a sudden pressure change and simplifies the equilibration of the system.},

Lett. 50, 1285 (1983)], based on density-functional theory, as a new means of calculating ground-state properties of realistic metal systems. We derive an expression for the total energy of a metal using the embedding energy from which we obtain several ground-state properties, such as the lattice constant, elastic constants, sublimation energy, and vacancy-formation energy. We obtain the embedding energy and accompanying pair potentials semiempirically for Ni and Pd, and use these to treat several problems: surface energy and relaxation of the (100), (110), and (111) faces; properties of H in bulk metal (H migration, binding of H to vacancies, and lattice expansion in the hydride phase); binding site and adsorption energy of hydrogen on (100), (110), and (111) surfaces; and lastly, fracture of Ni and the effects of hydrogen on the fracture. We emphasize problems with hydrogen and with surfaces because none of these can be treated with pair potentials. The agreement with experiment, the applicability to practical problems, and the simplicity of the technique make it an effective tool for atomistic studies of defects in metals.},

It is essentially a particle technique in which molecules are clustered into the said particles, and this coarse graining is a very important aspect of the DPD as it allows significant computational speed-up. This increased computational efficiency, coupled with the recent advent of high performance computing, has subsequently enabled researchers to numerically study a host of complex fluid applications at a refined level. In this review, we trace the developments of various important aspects of the DPD methodology since it was first proposed in the in the early 1990's. In addition, we review notable published works which employed DPD simulation for complex fluid applications.},

abstract = {Computer simulation is an essential tool in studying the chemistry and physics of liquids. Simulations allow us to develop models and to test them against experimental data. They can be used to evaluate approximate theories of liquids, and to provide detailed information on the structure and dynamics of model liquids at the molecular level. This book is an introduction and practical guide to the molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods. The first four chapters describe these methods in detail, and provide the essential background in intermolecular forces and statistical mechanics. Chapters 5 and 6 emphasize the practical aspects of writing efficient programs and analysing the simulation results. The remaining chapters cover advanced techniques, non-equilibrium methods, Brownian dynamics, quantum simulations, and some important applications. FORTRAN code is presented in the text.},

@article{Akkermans2008,
abstract = {We present an efficient, systematic, and universal method to estimate the interaction parameters used in mesoscale simulation methods such as dissipative particle dynamics and self-consistent field methods from molecular cluster calculations. The method is based on a generalized Flory-Huggins model in which molecules, or fragments thereof, are in contact with their van der Waals surface. We sample the density of states of molecular clusters in the space spanned by the coarse-grained degrees of freedom. From here, we calculate the sum over states and free energy of the cluster at a temperature of interest by histogram reweighting. The method allows to calculate the energy and entropy contributions to the cluster free energy explicitly. For two components, we then obtain the excess free energy of mixing and the Flory-Huggins chi-parameter, and their energetic and entropic contributions. We present two applications of the method: a simple liquid mixture of hexane and nitrobenzene, and a series of polymer blends. In the case of hexane/nitrobenzene, we compare to alternative simulation methods; here we find that the energy of mixing alone is too high to explain the critical point. By including the excess entropy of mixing, however, the predicted phase behavior is in reasonable agreement with experiment. The tendency of calculations based on average energy alone to overestimate the chi-parameter is also apparent in the polymer blend calculations.},

abstract = {The energy band structures of TiC, VC, Ti4C3 and V4C3 have been studied by the linear muffin-tin-orbital method (LMTO). The influence of vacancies on the density of states (DOS) in the 2s C-band is a uniform reduction and a narrowing of this DOS. The splitting of the peak in the low-energy part of the 2p C, 3d Me-band (Me = Ti, V) is observed, while in the neighbourhood of the Fermi energy two peaks of DOS appear which consist of 3d Me- and vacancy states. Under the influence of vacancies the electronic charge in the carbon atomic sphere is shifted partly into the vacancy sphere. For Ti4C3, the increase of the Fermi energy and DOS at this energy is observed, while in the case of V4C3 these values decrease. In the presence of vacancies a contraction of crystal lattice is observed while the bulk moduli of TiC and VC diminish which is most pronounced for VC. The results are compared with previous data obtained by the LCAO coherent potential and APW calculations and with the experimental data concerning the DOS at the Fermi energy. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

The calculated values for the equilibrium volume, bulk modulus, and elastic constants are generally in very good agreement with experiments. At elevated pressures all these compounds are predicted to undergo a structural phase transition from the relatively open NaCl structure into the more dense CsCl atomic arrangement.

Over a T range of T, rt 50", this applies to a wide variety of polymers, polymer solutions, organic glass-forming liquids, and inorganic glasses. If, alternatively, the reference temperature is chosen as T,, then log UT - 17.44 (T - Tg)/(51.6 + T - TE). Above T. + 50 (or T, + 100) the equation fails because different systems show specific properties which are no longer dominated by the non-specific behavior associated with supercooling and vitrification. The apparent activation energy for relaxation processes, unlike UT, is not a universal function of T - T. or T - T,. Our empirical equations are shown to be consistent with earlier formulations of Fox and Flory, Tobolsky, Dienes and Bueche over limited temperature ranges. Comparison with a simplified version of Doolittle's free space equation for temperature dependence of viscosity shows that our empirical constants are determined by the increase in thermal expansion coefficient at the glass transition temperature and the fractional free volume at that point. deg.-], in rather good agreement with experimental measurements, and 0.025, a reasonable value.},

abstract = {The forced water-oil displacement in capillary is a model that has important applications such as the groundwater remediation and the oil recovery. Whereas it is difficult for experimental studies to observe the displacement process in a capillary at nanoscale, the computational simulation is a unique approach in this regard. In the present work, the many-body dissipative particle dynamics (MDPD) method is employed to simulate the process of water-oil displacement in capillary with external force applied by a piston. As the property of all interfaces involved in this system can be manipulated independently, the dynamic displacement process is studied systematically under various conditions of distinct wettability of water in capillary and miscibility between water and oil as well as of different external forces. By analyzing the dependence of the starting force on the properties of water/capillary and water/oil interfaces, we find that there exist two different modes of the water-oil displacement. In the case of stronger water-oil interaction, the water particles cannot displace those oil particles sticking to the capillary wall, leaving a low oil recovery efficiency. To minimize the residual oil content in capillary, enhancing the wettability of water and reducing the external force will be beneficial. This simulation study provides microscopic insights into the water-oil displacement process in capillary and guiding information for relevant applications.},

The DPD model is constructed to match the physical description and structural properties of the PS-b-PI diblock copolymer. A coarse-grained force field has been developed for the diblock copolymer system in DPD simulations. The new force field contains bonded and nonbonded interaction terms, which are derived from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and determined by fitting experimental data of the compressibility of water at room temperature and interfacial tension values, respectively.

This method allows one to predict the most stable crystal structure and a number of low-energy metastable structures for a given compound at any P-T conditions without requiring any experimental input. Extremely high (nearly 100{\%}) success rate has been observed in a few tens of tests done so far, including ionic, covalent, metallic, and molecular structures with up to 40 atoms in the unit cell. We have been able to resolve some important problems in high-pressure crystallography and report a number of new high-pressure crystal structures (stable phases: epsilon-oxygen, new phase of sulphur, new metastable phases of carbon, sulphur and nitrogen, stable and metastable phases of CaCO3). Physical reasons for the success of this methodology are discussed.},

abstract = {Lowe-Andersen (LA) temperature controlling method [C. P. Lowe, Europhys. Lett. 47, 145 (1999)] is applied in a series of mesoscopic polymer simulations to test its validity and efficiency. The method is an alternative for dissipative particle dynamics simulation (DPD) technique which is also Galilean invariant. It shows excellent temperature control and gives correct radial distribution function as that from DPD simulation. The efficiency of LA method is compared with other typical DPD integration schemes and is proved to be moderately efficient. Moreover, we apply this approach to diblock copolymer microphase separation simulations. With LA method, we are able to reproduce all the results from the conventional DPD simulations. The calculated structure factors of the microphases are consistent with the experiments. We also study the microphase evolution dynamics with increasing chiN and find that the bath collision frequency Gamma does not affect the order of appearing phases. Although the thermostat does not affect the surface tension, the order-disorder transition (ODT) is somewhat sensitive to the values of Gamma, i.e., the ODT is nonmonotonic with increasing Gamma. The dynamic scaling law is also tested, showing that the relation obeys the Rouse theory with various Gamma.},

(1992) Topics in Fracture and Fatigue, pp. 1-58; Sun et al. (1993) Mater. Sci. Engng A170, 67-85, heretofore developed for isotropic solids, is generalized to take into account elastic anisotropy. An incipient dislocation core, represented in terms of a critical configuration at the crack tip, is determined numerically (most simply in the shear-only version of the model, but also for a combined tension-shear version that includes tension-shear coupling constrained by atomic modeling). These solutions improve upon approximations based on an effective shear stress intensity. For fcc crystals and intermetallics, the nucleation event analysed is that of a set of partial dislocations emitted sequentially. The anisotropic formulation accounts for corrections as large as 30{\%} in the critical value of the stress intensity factor for atomic decohesion, or cleavage. The anisotropic critical crack extension force for dislocation emission may be greater or less than its isotropic counterpart. For an embedded-atom-method (EAM) model of bcc alpha-Fe, the anisotropic values can be as large as 2.4 times the isotropic ones in one crack orientation; in another crack orientation, the values are as much as 40{\%} less than the isotropic analogs. For fcc structures (EAM nickel, aluminum and Ni3Al), the difference is within a 10-25{\%} range. For silicon, the isotropic formulation is good, with less than a 14{\%} difference from the anisotropic counterpart. The anisotropic effects are found to increase with a standard ratio of elastic anisotropy, and are important for predicting intrinsic ductile versus brittle response.},

abstract = {A symmetry-general scheme for the simultaneous least-squares extraction of the elastic coefficients and of the residual strain components from ab initio total energy calculations on crystal structure models of materials is proposed. It is quite efficient and avoids error propagation. An appropriate, but usually singular: set of normal equations is first formulated in a triclinic framework, with 21 stiffness coefficients and 6 residual strain components. Rank reduction of this 27 x 27 least-squares system of normal equations is then performed through systematic implementation of the constraints corresponding to the known symmetry of the material. A regular p x p matrix is obtained through this process, where p is the total number of independent coefficients and components. This computationally robust approach to the extraction of elastic coefficients and their standard deviations can be used to analyze any number of adequately selected and weighted values of the total energy that is larger than the number of independent parameters. It also provides values for the minimum energy and for the corresponding cell data, again with standard errors. The present work enables the automated calculation of elastic coefficients from crystals with any symmetry through a single logical flow. Examples are given for a few cubic, hexagonal, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and orthorhombic materials with known experimental stiffness values. It would be difficult to exaggerate the convenience of the automated implementation of this symmetry-general approach based on total energy calculations.},

abstract = {The relaxations and energies of the (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (1 1 1) surfaces of (bcc) Fe have been calculated using density functional theory. A plane-wave pseudopotential method was employed. The results demonstrate that for the (1 0 0) surface a contraction of the first (outer) layer is observed while the second and third layers expand perpendicular to the surface plane; for the (1 1 0) surface, the displacements are the same, however, the magnitude of the relaxations is much smaller, showing the surface to be basically bulk terminated; for the (1 1 1) surface the first two layers contract while the third expands, with the magnitude of the relaxations being much larger than for the other surfaces. The surface energy values for the relaxed and unrelaxed surfaces were determined showing the (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) surfaces to have almost identical surface energies with the (100) being slightly higher followed by the (1 1 1) surface. Our results are compared to other experimental and computational studies and generally show good agreement with experiment; an explanation is provided for any differences. The surface models used in this study provide a good basis for future work examining the adsorption of impurities on the surface and the effect of relaxation on adhesion. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The lattice parameters, formation energies and bulk moduli of (Ti, M)C and M(C, Va) with the B1 crystal structure have been investigated using first-principles calculations, where M = Nb, V, Mo and W. The replacement at 0 K of Ti by Mo or W in the TiC lattice is found to be energetically unfavorable with respect to the formation energy. However, it decreases the misfit strain between the carbide and ferrite matrix, a factor which is of critical importance during the early stages of precipitation, thus favoring the substitution of Ti by Mo, as is observed in practice. The effect of Mo in enhancing the coarsening resistance of (Ti, Mo)C precipitates is discussed in terms of its role in the nucleation process, but followed by a more passive contribution during coarsening itself. The role of tungsten has been predicted to have a similar effect to molybdenum on the nucleation and coarsening process. Analysis of precipitates in Ti-, Ti-Mo- and Ti-W-bearing steels shows results consistent with the calculations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {We present the results of Kohn-Sham calculations on molecules, surfaces, and solids which were obtained using a recently proposed exchange-correlation energy functional [ Z. Wu and R. E. Cohen Phys. Rev. B 73 235116 (2006)]. The Wu-Cohen (WC) functional, like the well-known PBE functional [ J. P. Perdew et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 77 3865 (1996)], is of the generalized gradient approximation form and was derived from the homogeneous electron gas and mathematical relations obeyed by the exact functional. The results on molecular systems show that among the functionals we tested, PBE remains superior for the energetics of covalent and noncovalent bonds. While this is not too surprising for noncovalent bonds due to the very good performance of PBE, unfortunately this holds also for covalent bonds, where PBE is a functional of rather poor quality. Calculations on transition-metal surfaces show that WC improves over local-density approximation (LDA) and PBE for the surface formation energy of 3d elements, while LDA is the best for heavier elements. In most cases, the lattice constant of solids as determined by the WC functional is in between the LDA and PBE results and on average closer to experiment. We show for each group of compounds which functional performs best and provide trends. In the particular case of lattice constants whose values are determined by weak interactions (e.g., the interlayer distance in graphite), the LDA functional is more accurate than the generalized gradient approximation functionals.},

abstract = {We report periodic spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) predictions of hydrogen adsorption, absorption, dissolution, and diffusion energetics on and in ferromagnetic (FM) body-centered cubic (bcc) iron. We find that H prefers to stay on the Fe surface instead of subsurfaces or in bulk. Hydrogen dissolution in bulk Fe is predicted to be endothermic, with hydrogen occupying tetrahedral (t) sites over a wide range of concentrations. This is consistent with the known low solubility of H in pure Fe. In the initial absorption step, we predict that H occupies the deep subsurface t-site for Fe(110) and the shallow subsurface t-site for Fe(100). Diffusion of H into Fe subsurfaces is predicted to have a much lower barrier for Fe(100) than Fe(110). For H diffusion in bulk Fe, we find that H diffuses through bcc Fe not via a straight line trajectory, but rather hops from one t-site to a neighboring t-site by a curved path. Moreover, we exclude a previously suggested path via the octahedral site, due to its higher barrier and the rank of the saddle point. Quantum effects on H diffusion through bulk Fe are discussed.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the processing of refractory carbides and nitrides in the form of powders, bulk/monolithic shapes, fibers, and whiskers. The bulk/monolithic and thermal spray processes for refractory carbides and nitrides are two-step operations, which first require the preparation of powders. Powders are also used as such in grinding and polishing applications (mostly silicon carbide and boron carbide). These powders are produced by a variety of experimental or production processes, which can offer controlled composition, small particle size, and high purity. Refractory carbide and nitride powders are usually produced by the chemical reaction among the elements or compounds of the elements. These processes are moderate in cost, but do not generally produce materials of the highest purity and consistency. High-quality powders of refractory carbides and nitrides can be obtained by the more recent processing techniques of chemical-vapor deposition (CVD), RF-plasma torch, combustion synthesis, and sol-gel. The fabrication of refractory carbides and nitrides entails two major steps: (1) pressing the powder to the required shape, and (2) sintering (or firing) it at high temperature. Sintering is a complex physical and chemical phenomenon. It causes the loose powder particles to bond together and usually results in shrinkage, densification, and grain growth. The characteristics of the powder govern to a great degree the physical and chemical properties of the final ceramic product. },

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the applications of refractory carbides and nitrides in each of the following industrial categories: (1) automotive and aerospace, (2) industrial machinery and equipment, (3) cutting and grinding tools, (4) armor, (5) nuclear, (6) semiconductor, and (6) optical. Many of the automotive and aerospace applications of refractory carbides and nitrides are of a structural and chemical nature, especially in applications involving high temperature and/or corrosive environments where most metals are no longer suitable. These applications are usually in the bulk form and are made possible by recent advances in processing technology. Relatively large parts can now be produced to near-net shape with little machining required. Applications of refractory carbides and nitrides are found extensively in machinery and equipment for protection against wear, erosion, and chemical attack. Both bulk materials and coatings are used. The most important bulk material is tungsten carbide sintered with a metallic binder that is usually cobalt. Cutting and grinding tools are a special case of wear and corrosion applications. Cutting tools have a sharp edge for the purpose of shaving and generating a material chip. This edge must remain sharp for the tool to perform properly. Grinding tools are different in that they have an abrasive-coated surface that generates a powder as opposed to the chip of a cutting tool. },

abstract = {The mobility of dissolved hydrogen in an iron lattice having a population of extraordinary, or trapping, sites for hydrogen is analyzed under the assumption of local equilibrium between the mobile and the trapped populations. It is shown that at low coverage of the trapping sites the usual solutions of the diffusion equations can be used to analyze the experimental results and that the effective diffusivity is a function of trap density and of the magnitude of the trap depth. In the domain of coverage in which the activity of trapped hydrogen is not linear in the fractional occupation of the trap population, the concept of phenomenological diffusivity becomes non-operational and the diffusion equation must be solved with terms for sources and sinks, as done by McNabb and Foster. Values for trap number and depth are obtained by applying the relevant equations to selected data on a variety of steels with and without cold work. The results lead to the suggestion that in the absence of cold work the solid-solid interfaces are as or more important than dislocations as loci of trapping sites, and that in cold-worked steels, microcrack surfaces are more important than dislocations for hydrogen trapping.

Consideration is given to the effect that non-stoichiometry and the ordering of structural vacancies have on the heat capacity of the VC, carbide. Temperatures and heats of reversible equilibrium disorder-order transitions are determined. The ordering transformations VCgamma-V6C5 and VCgamma-V8C7 are shown to be first-order phase transitions. An equilibrium phase diagram of the V-C system is constructed which allows for the formation of ordered phases in a non-stoichiometric vanadium carbide. The order parameter functional method is used for calculation of phase equilibria in the region of ordering of non-stoichiometric cubic VC, carbide.},

abstract = {Elastic properties play a key role in materials science and technology. The elastic tensors at any order are defined by the Taylor expansion of the elastic energy or stress in terms of the applied strain. In this paper, we present ElaStic, a tool that is able to calculate the full second-order elastic stiffness tensor for any crystal structure from ab initio total-energy and/or stress calculations. This tool also provides the elastic compliances tensor and applies the Voigt and Reuss averaging procedure in order to obtain an evaluation of the bulk, shear, and Young moduli as well as the Poisson ratio of poly-crystalline samples. In a first step, the space-group is determined. Then, a set of deformation matrices is selected, and the corresponding structure files are produced. In a next step, total-energy or stress calculations for each deformed structure are performed by a chosen density-functional theory code. The computed energies/stresses are fitted as polynomial functions of the applied strain in order to get derivatives at zero strain. The knowledge of these derivatives allows for the determination of all independent components of the elastic tensor. In this context, the accuracy of the elastic constants critically depends on the polynomial fit. Therefore, we carefully study how the order of the polynomial fit and the deformation range influence the numerical derivatives, and we propose a new approach to obtain the most reliable results. We have applied ElaStic to representative materials for each crystal system, using total energies and stresses calculated with the full-potential all-electron codes exciting and WIEN2k as well as the pseudo-potential code Quantum ESPRESSO. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The PBE functional [J. P. Perdew et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 3865 (1996)], the most common of them, provides excellent results in many cases. However, very recently other GGA functionals have been proposed and compete in accuracy with the PBE functional, in particular for the structure of solids. We have tested these GGA functionals, as well as the local-density approximation (LDA) and TPSS (meta-GGA approximation) functionals, on a large set of solids using an accurate implementation of the Kohn-Sham equations, namely, the full-potential linearized augmented plane-wave and local orbitals method. Often these recently proposed GGA functionals lead to improvement over LDA and PBE, but unfortunately none of them can be considered as good for all investigated solids.},

abstract = {A first-principles computational tensile test has been preformed to investigate the effects of hydrogen on a tungsten grain boundary. It has been found that the maximum ideal tensile strength of the tungsten grain boundary with hydrogen atom segregation was 32.85 GPa, which was about 9{\%} lower than that of the clean tungsten grain boundary (36.23 GPa). This indicated that the theoretical strength of the tungsten grain boundary became weaker in the presence of the hydrogen atom. Atomic configuration analysis showed that the grain boundary fracture was caused by the interfacial bond breaking. The Griffith fracture energy was calculated to be 161 meV/?? 2 (2.58 J/m 2) and 155 meV/?? 2 (2.48 J/m 2) for the tungsten grain boundary without and with the hydrogen atom segregation, respectively. The solution energy of the hydrogen atom in a fracture free surface was -0.31 eV, which was 0.08 eV lower than that of the hydrogen atom in a tungsten grain boundary. This indicated that hydrogen was a grain boundary embrittler according to the Rice-Wang thermodynamic theory. The Bader charge analysis suggested that the physical origin for hydrogen-induced embrittlement was the charge transfer induced by hydrogen in the tungsten grain boundary.},

The friction coefficient significantly decreased as the MoS2 tribofilm was formed. Besides, sliding was observed between sulfur layers of MoS2 tribofilms which occurred due to repulsive Coulombic interaction forces between sulfur atoms. This indicates that the formation of the layered MoS2 tribofilm is important to achieve better lubrication properties.},

First the famous 1C-1.5Cr steel from which the majority of bearings are made. Its structure is apparently well-understood and the focus is on purity in order to avoid inclusions which initiate fatigue during rolling contact. Then there is the M50 steel and its variants, from which bearings which serve at slightly higher temperatures in aeroengines are manufactured, based on secondary-hardened martensite. The casual metallurgist would be wrong; there is a richness in the subject which inspires deep study. There are phenomena which are little understood, apparently incommensurate observations, some significant developments and other areas where convincing conclusions are difficult to reach. The subject seemed ready for a critical assessment; hence, this review. The structure and properties of bearing steels prior to the point of service are first assessed and described in the context of steelmaking, manufacturing and engineering requirements. This is followed by a thorough critique of the damage mechanisms that operate during service and in accelerated tests. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {The interface energies and electronic structures of the interfaces between BCC Fe and transition metal carbides have been investigated using first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. The effects of the composition and configuration of the carbides on the interface properties have been determined. It was shown that the Fe/TiC interface has the highest interface energy and the formation of complex carbides leads to a significant decrease in the interface energy. The complex carbide of (Ti 0.5Mo0.5)C, which has Mo present at the interface, has been found to be the most stable. From the analysis of the density of states, the stability of the Mo-segregated (Ti0.5Mo0.5)C carbides has been revealed to be due to the hybridization of the d-orbitals in the t 2g local symmetry between Mo and its first nearest neighboring Fe atoms. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of the nanometric cutting of single-crystal copper were performed with the embedded atom method. The nature of material removal, chip formation, material defects and frictional forces were simulated. Nanometric cutting was found to comprise two steps: material removal as the tool machines the top surface, followed by relaxation of the work material to a low defect configuration, after the tool or abrasive particle has passed over the machined region. During nanometric cutting there is a local region of higher temperature and stress below the tool, for large cutting speeds. Relaxation anneals this excess energy and leads to lower dislocation work material. At high cutting speeds (180 m s(-1)), the machined surface is rough but the work material is dislocation free after the large excess energy has annealed the work material. At lower cutting speeds (1.8-18 m s(-1)), the machined surface is smooth, with dislocations remaining in the substrate, and there is only a small excess temperature in the work material after machining. The size of the chip grows with increasing cutting speed.},

abstract = {A detailed and systematic density-functional theory (DFT) study of a series of early transition-metal carbides (TMCs) in the NaCl structure is presented. The focus is on the trends in the electronic structure and nature of bonding, which are essential for the understanding of the reactivity of TMCs. The employed approach is based on a thorough complementary analysis of the electron density differences, the density of states (DOS), the band structure and the real-space wavefunctions to gain an insight into the bonding of this class of materials and get a more detailed picture of it than previously achieved, as the trend study allows for a systematic identification of the bond character along the different bands. Our approach confirms the presence of both the well-known TM-C and TM-TM bonds and, more importantly, it shows the existence and significance of direct C-C bonds in all investigated TMCs, which are frequently neglected but have been identified in some cases (Zhang et al 2002 Solid State Commun. 121 411; Ruberto et al 2007 Phys. Rev. B 75 235438). New information on the spatial extent of the bonds, their k-space location within the band structure and their importance for the bulk cohesion is provided. Trends in covalency and ionicity are presented. The resulting electron-structural trends are analyzed and discussed within a two-level model.},

@article{Fournier1982,
abstract = {A recurrent problem in generating realistic pictures by computers is to represent natural irregular objects and phenomena without undue time or space overhead. We develop a new and powerful solution to this computer graphics problem by modeling objects as sample paths of stochastic processes. Of particular interest are those stochastic processes which previously have been found to be useful models of the natural phenomena to be represented. One such model applicable to the representation of terrains, known as “fractional Brownian motion,” has been developed by Mandelbrot. The value of a new approach to object modeling in computer graphics depends largely on the efficiency of the techniques used to implement the model. We introduce a new algorithm that computes a realistic, visually satisfactory approximation to fractional Brownian motion in faster time than with exact calculations. A major advantage of this technique is that it allows us to compute the surface to arbitrary levels of details without increasing the database. Thus objects with complex appearances can be displayed from a very small database. The character of the surface can be controlled by merely modifying a few parameters. A similar change allows complex motion to be created inexpensively.},

abstract = {Molecular-dynamics simulations are used to gain insights on recent sum-frequency spectroscopy and polarised neutron reflectometry measurements of the structure of hexadecylamine films adsorbed on iron-oxide surfaces in dodecane and hexadecane. Simulations were carried out under quiescent and high-shear conditions. Mass-density profiles, molecular-height and molecular-orientation probability distribution functions, and in-layer radial distribution functions were calculated. The simulation results show that at high surface coverage, the film thickness is about 15 {\AA}, and that the molecules are mainly pointing upwards from the surface at an angle of 40–501. The results are compared critically against published experimental results, and the agreement is found to be good. The in-layer ordering of the hexadecylamine head-group atoms is found to be dictated by the crystalline structure of the iron-oxide surface, but this influence rapidly diminishes along the molecular backbone. The tail-group atoms show almost no positional ordering. Finally, an example calculation of the kinetic friction coefficient under high-shear conditions is presented. The lateral (friction) force is measured as a function of the normal (applied) force, and the kinetic friction coefficient is determined to be about 0.09, which is typical for this kind of system.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reveals the properties of silicon carbide and boron carbide and provides a summary of the fabrication processes and applications of these two compounds. Silicon carbide (SiC) and boron carbide to a lesser degree are important industrial materials, which are produced on a large scale in the form of powders, molded shapes, and thin films. Both covalent carbides have high melting points, which are slightly lower than the titanium compounds but higher than silicon and boron. Under most conditions, the thermal decomposition of SiC may occur well below its intrinsic melting point and decomposition can become significant at approximately 1700°C. The density of SiC is closer to that of diamond than it is to graphite, which can be expected because SiC has the structure of diamond. Boron carbide does not appear to decompose up to its melting point. It vaporizes by the preferential loss of gaseous boron. The thermal conductivity of covalent carbides, unlike that of the interstitial carbides, decreases with increasing temperature. The thermal conductivity of silicon carbide is high, yet considerably lower than that of the best conductors such as Type {\{}II{\}} diamond, silver, copper, beryllium oxide, and aluminum nitride. },

This is due to the lack of interatomic potentials for these systems, which in turn can be traced to a lack of understanding of the underlying physics. We discuss the discrepancies between theory and experiment regarding crystal structure and elastic moduli in NiTi, in particular that ab initio calculations predict that the stable crystal structure is B33, not the experimentally observed B19???. Despite the lack of NiTi potentials, insight can be gained from studying transitions in related martensitic materials: We present simulations of the body-centered cubic (bcc) to hexagonal close-packed (hcp) transition using a new potential for Zr which, for the first time, properly represents the phase transition. We find that the bcc-hcp phase transition is accompanied by precursor long wavelength instability and rotation of the bcc matrix. We show that strain of the bcc structure is accommodated by martensite formation, especially at temperatures close to the phase transition. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The interstitial nitrides, titanium nitride in particular, are major industrial materials. Interstitial nitrides are crystalline compounds of a host metal and nitrogen where the nitrogen atom occupies specific interstitial sites in the metal structure, which is generally close packed. This places a lower limit on the size of the metal atom for the nitrogen atom to fit in the available sites of the metal structure. Interstitial nitrides are similar to interstitial carbides in structure and composition and the two groups of materials closely resemble each other. The nitrides however are not as refractory as carbides. The interstitial nitrides are susceptible to the presence of even minute amounts of impurities, particularly oxygen, which tend to distort the structure. Like the carbides, the interstitial nitrides allow nonmetal vacancies (i.e., nitrogen) in the lattice, but unlike the carbides they also tolerate metal-atom vacancies. },

This chapter provides a general review of the structural characteristics of interstitial carbides. Interstitial carbides are crystalline compounds of a host metal and carbon. The host-metal atoms are generally arranged in a close-packed structure and the carbon occupies specific interstitial sites in that structure. Such a model sets size restrictions on the two elements for the carbon atom to fit into the available sites, and the population of these sites determines the stoichiometry of the carbide. The interstitial carbides have several important characteristics in common like they fully meet the refractory criteria; their interstitial structures lead to a combination of metallic, covalent, and ionic bonds; they are primarily non-stoichiometric phases and ordering of the carbon atoms is common; they combine the physical properties of ceramics and the electronic properties of metals—i.e., high hardness and strength with high thermal and electrical conductivities; they have the highest melting points of any group of materials; and they have high thermal and chemical stability. },

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter provides a review of the characteristics and properties of the interstitial carbides formed by the metals of Group VI: chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. These three carbide systems have similar atomic bonding, composition, and crystallography. Their properties and characteristics are also similar. The carbides of Group {\{}VI{\}} are important industrial materials, particularly tungsten carbide and chromium carbide. The density of these carbides increases considerably with the increasing atomic number of the metal. The carbides of Group {\{}VI{\}} have melting points that are lower than those of their respective host metals but are relatively close to those of the borides. Like the other interstitial carbides, the carbides of Group {\{}VI{\}} are good thermal conductors, thus, reflecting their metallic character. This is especially true of tungsten carbide (WC) that has the highest thermal conductivity of any of the transition-metal carbides and can be considered as an excellent thermal conductor. The Group {\{}VI{\}} carbides are chemically stable and have a chemical resistance similar to that of the Group {\{}IV{\}} carbides. },

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the structural characteristics of covalent carbides—that is, boron carbide and silicon carbide. The two covalent carbides have certain general features such as they fully meet the refractory criteria of high melting point and thermal and chemical stability; they are nonmetallic compounds; their electronic bonding is essentially covalent; they have low density; their elemental constituents have low atomic weight; they have useful semiconductor properties; and they are extremely hard and strong materials, which exhibit typical ceramic characteristics. The atomic and crystalline structures of covalent carbides are less complex and generally better understood and characterized than those of interstitial carbides. Bonding is essentially covalent where the carbon atoms bond to the silicon or boron atoms by sharing a pair of electrons and like all covalent bonds, these atoms forms definite bond angles. The bonding is achieved by the hybridization of the valence electrons of the respective atoms. },

abstract = {We present an off-lattice, on-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) model for simulating stress-assisted diffusion and trapping of hydrogen by crystalline defects in iron. Given an embedded atom (EAM) potential as input, energy barriers for diffusion are ascertained on the fly from the local environments of H atoms. To reduce computational cost, on-the-fly calculations are supplemented with precomputed strain-dependent energy barriers in defect-free parts of the crystal. These precomputed barriers, obtained with high-accuracy density functional theory calculations, are used to ascertain the veracity of the EAM barriers and correct them when necessary. Examples of bulk diffusion in crystals containing a screw dipole and vacancies are presented. Effective diffusivities obtained from KMC simulations are found to be in good agreement with theory. Our model provides an avenue for simulating the interaction of hydrogen with cracks, dislocations, grain boundaries, and other lattice defects, over extended time scales, albeit at atomistic length scales.},

abstract = {A symmetry-general approach for the least-squares, therefore precise, extraction of elastic coefficients for strained materials is reported. It analyzes stresses calculated ab initio for properly selected strains. The problem, its implementation, and its solution strategy all differ radically from a previous energy-strain approach that we published last year, but the normal equations turn out to be amenable to the same constrainment scheme that makes both approaches symmetry general. The symmetry considerations governing the automated selection of appropriately strained models and their Cartesian systems are detailed. The extension to materials under general stress is discussed and implemented. VASP was used for ab initio calculation of stresses. A comprehensive range of examples includes a triclinic material (kyanite) and simple materials with a range of symmetries at zero pressure, MgO under hydrostatic pressure, Ti4As3 under [001] uniaxial strain, and Si under [001] uniaxial stress. The MgO case agrees with recent experimental work including elastic coefficients as well as their first and second derivatives. The curves of elastic coefficients for Si show a gradual increase in the 33 compliance coefficient, leading to a collapse of the material at -11.7 GPa, compared with -12.0 GPa experimentally. Interpretation of results for Be using two approximations [local density (LDA), generalized gradient (GGA)], two approaches (stress strain and energy strain!, two potential types (projector augmented wave and ultrasoft), and two quantum engines (VASP and ORESTES) expose the utmost importance of the cell data used for the elastic calculations and the lesser importance of the other factors. For stiffness at relaxed cell data, differences are shown to originate mostly in the considerable overestimation of the residual compressive stresses at x-ray cell data by LDA, resulting in a smaller relaxed cell, thus larger values for diagonal stiffness coefficients. The symmetry generality of the approach described here enabled the creation of a robust user interface going seamlessly from the database search to the printout of the elastic coefficients. With it, even nonspecialist users can reliably produce technologically relevant results like those discussed here in a simple point-and-click fashion from corresponding entries in the CRYSTMET(R) and ICSD(R) structure databases, i.e., for all pure-phase nonorganic materials with known crystal structure. The case of Ti4As3 exposes, on a first cluster of properties, stiffness, compliance, and the isotropic properties that can be derived from them, the current reality of mining crystal structure databases with ab initio software for technological properties that were never measured before. Further developments in that direction are currently underway.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter provides a review of the characteristics and properties of the interstitial carbides formed by the metals of Group IV: titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. The rationale for reviewing these compounds together is their similarity in atomic bonding, composition, and crystallography. These carbides also have similar properties and characteristics. Of the three, titanium carbide has been investigated more and is the most important from an application standpoint. It is produced industrially on a large scale in the form of powders, molded shapes, and thin films. Interstitial carbides are essentially non-stoichiometric compounds and the variations in the reported property values often found in the literature reflect this characteristic. The density of these carbides increases considerably with the increasing atomic number of the metal. The melting points of these carbides are higher in all cases than those of the other compounds and particularly those of the host metals. The thermal conductivity or k (i.e., the time rate of transfer of heat by conduction) of interstitial carbides is different from that of most other refractory materials as k increases with increasing temperature. },

abstract = {A critical problem for wind turbine gearboxes is failure of rolling element bearings where axial cracks form on the inner rings. Metallurgical analyses show that the failure mode is associated with microstructural alterations manifested by white etching areas (WEAs) and white etching cracks (WECs). This article presents field experience from operating wind turbines that compares performance of through-hardened and carburized materials. It shows that through-hardened bearings develop WEA/WECs and fail with axial cracks, whereas carburized bearings do not. In another comparison of two rotor bearings with different carburized metallurgies, one bearing developed WEA/WECs and failed by macropitting, whereas the other bearing did not develop WEAs or WECs and did not fail. The field experience shows that a carburized bearing that has a core with low carbon content, high nickel content, greater compressive residual stresses, and a higher amount of retained austenite provides higher fracture resistance and makes carburized bearings more durable than through-hardened bearings in the wind turbine environment.},

abstract = {The presence of hydrogen may weaken the bonding of iron atoms at grain boundaries, leading to intergranular embrittlement and thus failure of the bulk material. In this paper, we study the interaction of hydrogen interstitials with close-packed and open grain boundary structures in $\alpha$- and $\gamma$ -Fe using density-functional theory. We find that hydrogen accommodation within the grain boundaries strongly depends on the local coordination of the available interstitial sites. Within the open grain boundary structures larger interstitial sites are available, enhancing the solubility as compared to that in the respective bulk phases. The mobility of hydrogen within the investigated grain boundaries is low compared to diffusion in perfect single-crystalline bulk. The grain boundaries do not provide fast diffusion channels for hydrogen, but act as hydrogen traps. Hydrogen that is accumulated within the grain boundaries can lead to a lowering of the critical strain required to fracture the material.},

The calculated topmost layer relaxations reproduce well the experimental contractions and their variation with the surface crystallographic orientation, and surface roughness. The multilayer relaxation sequences correlate with the reduced coordination in surface layers and can be explained in terms of a simple electrostatic picture. The surface energies scale almost linearly with the surface roughness. They agree well with the experimental surface tensions and show a small anisotropy in agreement with predictions based on measurements for other metals. The equilibrium shape of a bcc Fe crystal is determined and discussed. The work function anisotropy is calculated and rationalized in terms of changes in the valence charge distribution. Significantly increased local magnetic moments of atoms in the surface region are determined. The correlation between the anisotropy of the surface magnetic moments and atomic coordination in the outermost layers is demonstrated to follow a simple rule. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) seek to improve upon the accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3–4 {\%} is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.},

We have laid the groundwork necessary to determine the influence of microstructure in RCF and related very high cycle fatigue problems. Crystal plasticity material models provide more realistic accumulations of localized plastic strains with cycling compare to homogenized J2 plasticity. With J2 plasticity, the bearing must be overloaded to capture significant plasticity near inclusions; with crystal plasticity, realistic bench test loads can be applied with plastic strain accumulation observed near inclusions in cases where RCF failure is anticipated. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Arecently developed Fe-C interatomic potential has been used to investigate carbon in highly supersaturated ? iron with an emphasis on the possible ways in which carbon can arrange itself on the octahedral sites of the tetragonally distorted ? -iron lattice. Focusing particularly on the composition Fe16C2, the embedded atom method potential used gives the same ground-state structure of Fe16C2 as density-functional-theory calcula- tions. Moreover, when computing C-C interactions between two carbon atoms at0Kwith energy minimiza- tion, the preferred separation distance corresponds exactly to the octahedral site positions expected in Fe16C2. It has been shown with molecular dynamics that the carbon atoms in Fe16C2 change how they order on octahedral sites during heating and during cooling. Finally, when investigating the interaction energy of Fe1−xCx for different carbon compositions, it is found that there is a clear minimum at x=0.11 for the fully ordered structure, corresponding to Fe16C2 composition. The results of these calculations are discussed with particular reference to carbon ordering in ferrous martensite.},

A more complete discussion of the failure mechanism based on hydrogen-enhanced dislocation mobility is presented, and these observations are related to measurements of the macroscopic flow stress. The effects of hydrogen-induced slip localization on the measured flow stress is discussed. A theory of hydrogen shielding of the interaction of dislocations with elastic stress centres is outlined. It is shown that this shielding effect can account for the observed hydrogen-enhanced dislocation mobility.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reveals the properties and general characteristics of the interstitial nitrides formed by the metals of Group {\{}IV{\}} (titanium, zirconium, and hafnium) and Group V (vanadium, niobium, and tantalum). These six nitrides are the only refractory transition-metal nitrides. They have similar properties and characteristics and, of the six, titanium nitride has the greatest importance from an application standpoint. These nitrides are produced mostly in the form of coatings or powders. Like the interstitial carbides, interstitial nitrides are essentially non-stoichiometric compounds. The density of these nitrites increases considerably with the increasing atomic number of the metal. The melting point of the nitrides is lower in every case than that of the corresponding carbides but, with the exception of niobium nitride (NbN), higher than the parent metals. The interstitial nitrides are relatively good electrical conductors, although with a resistivity slightly higher than that of the corresponding carbides and the parent metals, but still reflecting the essentially metallic character of these compounds. },

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter provides a review of the general characteristics of the refractory nitrides and their classification. The refractory nitrides can be divided into two major types: the interstitial nitrides and the covalent nitrides. The refractory nitrides are in many respects similar to the refractory carbides. They are hard and wear-resistant with high melting points and good chemical resistance. They are important industrial materials and have a significant number of major applications in cutting and grinding tools, wear surfaces, semiconductors, and others. There are three general and interrelated atomic characteristics that play an essential part in the formation of nitrides: (1) the difference in electronegativity between the element nitrogen and the other element forming the nitride, (2) the size of the respective atoms, and (3) the electronic bonding characteristics of these atoms. The bonding is mostly metallic with some covalent and ionic bond components, giving the interstitial nitrides metallic characteristics such as high electrical and thermal conductivities. In addition, these materials have high melting points and high hardness; they are chemically inert but only the nitrides of Groups {\{}IV{\}} and V fully meet the refractory criteria. Unlike the interstitial nitrides, the covalent nitrides are not metallic compounds. The differences in electronegativity and atomic size between the nitrogen and the other element are small and their electronic bonding is essentially covalent. In this respect, they are similar to the covalent carbides. },

abstract = {We performed Density-Functional electronic structure calculations in order to investigate the high pressure behavior of Os beyond what is tractable experimentally with a diamond-anvil cell. In addition to the room-temperature and pressure structure hcp, two hypothetical structures of Os have been considered: fcc and $\omega$ (hexagonal phase with three atoms by unit cell). Phase transitions are suggested by these calculations. For calculating the bulk modulus, the reciprocal of the compressibility, of Os and that of diamond, the computed total energies vs volume curves were fit to three different equations of state. Several volume ranges have been considered during the fitting procedure. First, it is shown that the claim of Cynn Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 135701 (2002)] is confirmed at weak compression. Osmium is less compressible than diamond which is known as the hardest and the least compressible material. However, with increasing pressure osmium becomes more compressible than diamond. At strong compression, osmium transforms to the $\omega$ phase. It is also shown that the reconstructive phase transition hcp→fcc could be induced by cooling in this low compressibility material.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the structural characteristics of the refractory carbides and discusses their classification and general features. Refractory carbides have a high melting point, arbitrarily fixed at {\textgreater} 1800 °C, and have a high degree of chemical stability. Only the interstitial and covalent carbides fulfill these two qualifications. The intermediate and salt-like carbides do not meet one or both of these conditions and cannot be considered as refractory, yet they are important materials. The refractory carbides are hard and wear-resistant, have high melting points, and are chemically inert. In a relatively short time, they have become major industrial materials with numerous applications such as cutting and grinding tools, bearings, textile-machinery components, oxidation-resistant gas burners, and many others. Three general and interrelated atomic characteristics play an essential part in the formation of carbides (and indeed of all compounds): (1) the difference in electronegativity between carbon and the other element, (2) the size of the respective atoms, (3) and the bonding characteristics of these atoms. },

The conditions are discussed under which a description of such macromolecules by Kratky-Porod worm-like chains holds, and the question to what extent the persistence length depends on external conditions (such as solvent quality) is considered.

abstract = {The actual service life of wind turbine gearboxes is often well below the desired 20 years. One of the prevalent failure modes in gearbox bearing raceways is white structure flaking (WSF) by the formation of butterflies and white etching cracks with associated microstructural change called white etching areas. Despite these failures having been observed for two decades in various industries, the detailed reasons and mechanisms for their formation are not fully understood. In this review, white etching area formation mechanisms are discussed, specifically grain refinement, and effects of carbon/carbide in a range of bearing steels of widely differing carbon content. The review also highlights the severe transient, cyclic loading and tribochemical operating conditions of gearbox bearings and explains how these may act as drivers to produce WSF. Much previous research has focused on the detrimental effects of hydrogen, but other work suggests that hydrogen is not the only cause for WSF. Possible methods for preventing WSF are discussed, with attention paid to special steels such as high chromium steels, low carbon stainless nitrogen alloy steels and carbonitrided steels. Beneficial compressive residual stresses, surface coatings and enhanced lubrication and additive packages are shown to offer degrees of prevention, although the mechanisms leading to improvements are not fully understood.},

Using the method, the computation effort for the complete set of elastic constants (21 components for a triclinic crystal) of a crystal under a given strain state is similar to that for the bulk modulus, where the latter is normally calculated first together with the equilibrium volume by fitting the volume-dependent energy to an equation of state. The idea in the efficiency improvement is to apply linear-independent coupling strains to a crystal, and to extract the complete set of elastic constants simultaneously. For the new method, a single set of strains are universally applicable to all crystals, and less number of strains are needed for crystals of higher symmetry. Calculated single-crystal elastic constants of cubic diamond, hexagonal osmium, orthorhombic TiSi2 and monoclinic Mg5Si6 are given as examples. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Various protocols such as sliding standard deviation (SD) analysis (SSA) and Pages test analysis (PTA) have been used to estimate two-dimensional (2D) kinetic rates from the time course of displacement of molecular carrier. In the current work, we compared the estimations from both SSA and modified PTA using measured data from an optical trap assay and simulated data from a random number generator. Our results indicated that both SSA and PTA were reliable in estimating 2D kinetic rates. Parametric analysis also demonstrated that such the estimations were sensitive to parameters such as sampling rate, sliding window size, and threshold. These results furthered the understandings in quantifying the biophysics of receptorligand interactions.},

These three carbides have similar atomic bonding, composition, and crystallography. These carbides also have similar properties and characteristics. Only the monocarbide phases are of industrial importance. Tantalum carbide (TaC) is produced on a relatively large scale while the importance of vanadium carbide (VC) and niobium carbide (NbC) is still limited. The density of these carbides increases considerably with the increasing atomic number of the metal. The melting point of the carbides is higher in all cases than that of the other materials. The thermal conductivity of Group V carbides is relatively high and similar to that of the Group IV, showing the metallic character of these compounds. It is slightly lower than that of the host metals and increases with increasing temperature. The electrical resistivity of the carbides is only slightly higher than that of the host metals, reflecting the metallic character of these compounds and their strong metal-to-metal bond. The nitrides and especially the borides have lower resistivity. },

Examination of electron diffraction patterns revealed diffuse rings from M23C6 carbides, indicating amorphization and/or nanocrystallinity. Crystalline MC carbides were also found. No cavity formation was found although a significant amount of helium and hydrogen generation had been generated. TEM-EDS examination of extraction replicas for carbides from unirradiated and irradiated samples did not show any detectable changes in composition of either M23C6 or MC carbides.

abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the composition and structure of covalent nitrides including boron nitride, aluminum nitride, and silicon nitride. The three covalent nitrides have some common features like they fully meet the refractory criteria of high melting point and thermal and chemical stability; they have similar cubic structures; their electronic bonding is mainly covalent; they have low density; their elemental constituents have low atomic weight; they are good electrical insulators; they are hard and strong materials and exhibit typical ceramic characteristics; and they are produced industrially with important applications. Covalent nitrides have a relatively simple crystal structure and an atomic bonding that is less complex than the interstitial nitrides. The bonding is mostly covalent by the sharing of electrons and is achieved by the hybridization of the respective electron orbitals. Boron nitride (BN) is the only major compound known in the boron-nitrogen system and aluminum nitride (AlN) is the only major compound known in the aluminum-nitrogen system. },

The method allows high-quality first-principles molecular-dynamics calculations to be performed using the original fictitious Lagrangian approach of Car and Parrinello. Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions.

Some new exact limits for atoms and interfaces are obtained, as well as formal quantitative criteria for the validity of the local-density approximation and the gradient corrections to it. The scheme is applied to planar surface calculations, as well as to extensive self-consistent calculations of energies and densities in atoms. The results compare favorably, in every case attempted, to experimental and exact results that are available. A method is devised for separating exchange from correlation in atoms within the Kohn-Sham method, and is tested favorably against exact-exchange calculations. Finally, we apply these results to atoms using exact exchange plus our appropriately separated correlation expression. The results give atomic total energies to accuracies of ∼±0.01 Ry, and typically reduce the local-density-approximation error in density by an order of magnitude.},

We find that the lattice diffusivity is attenuated by two to four orders of magnitude due to the presence of dislocations. We also find that pipe diffusivity is vanishingly small along screw dislocations and demonstrate that dislocations do not provide fast diffusion pathways for hydrogen as is sometimes supposed. We make contact between our simulations and the predictions of Oriani's theory of ‘effective diffusivity', and find that local equilibrium is maintained between lattice and trap sites. We also find that the predicted effective diffusivity is in agreement with our simulated results in cases where the distribution of traps is spatially homogeneous; in the trapping of hydrogen by dislocations where this condition is not met, the Oriani effective diffusivity is in agreement with the simulations to within a factor of two.},

(iii) Most substitutional solutes (except Si, Cr, Mn, Co, and Mo) trap H with positive binding energies up to 0.25 eV. The maximum H binding energy for Si, Cr, Mn, Co and Mo is essentially zero, meaning they do not interact with H. (iv) The H-substitutional solute binding energies are roughly correlated with the solute atom's electronegativity and size. (v) The presence of a solute atom near a vacancy does not affect hydrogen binding to the vacancy provided the solute atom is not significantly larger than Fe. ?? 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.},

abstract = {This paper describes an investigation of electrodeposited Zn-14{\%} Ni and aluminium-based SermeTel 1140/962 coatings as possible replacements for cadmium. Slow strain rate tests were performed to measure the extent of direct hydrogen embrittlement of a high strength steel substrate as a result of the coating process and of hydrogen re-embrittlement caused by coating corrosion. The level of re-embrittlement was shown to depend on both the electrochemical potential of the coating and its barrier properties. Zn-14{\%} Ni coatings caused the most re-embrittlement as they had the most active potential and contained through-thickness defects which left the steel exposed to hydrogen uptake. The microstructure of the high strength steel was also shown to be an important factor affecting the extent of embrittlement. AerMet 100 steel was more resistant than 300M steel and this was attributed to the presence of reverted austenite surrounding the martensite laths in AerMet 100, which trapped absorbed hydrogen and prevented a critical hydrogen concentration being reached in the more susceptible martensite phase. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been reported that hydrogen stabilizes vacancies [1, 2], and changes the mobility of dislocations [3-5]. Furthermore, the hydrogen distribution is strongly influenced by the stress fields [3-6]. In order to advance our understanding about hydrogen related fractures of metals, it is essentially important to reveal the hydrogen distributions around various lattice defects and the hydrogen effects on defect-formation and defect-motion. In this study, first, we analyze the distributions of hydrogen trap energy around a vacancy, edge and screw dislocations, and grain boundaries in Fe using atomistic simulations and first principles calculations. We also report the influences of hydrogen on the defect energies and the number of trapped hydrogen under a thermal equilibrium condition.},

@article{Tseng2011,
abstract = {Extensive computer experiments have been conducted in order to shed light on the macroscopic shear flow behavior of liquid n-hexadecane fluid under isobaric-isothermal conditions through the nonequilibrium molecular dynamic methodology. With respect to shear rates, the accompanying variations in structural properties of the fluid span the microscopic range of understanding from the intrinsic to extrinsic characteristics. As drawn from the average value of bond length and bond angle, the distribution of dihedral angle, and the radius distribution function of intramolecular and intermolecular van der Waals distances, these intrinsic structures change with hardness, except in the situation of extreme shear rates. The shear-induced variation of thermodynamic state curve along with the shear rate studied is shown to consist of both the quasiequilibrium state plateau and the nonequilibrium-thermodynamic state slope. Significantly, the occurrence of nonequilibrium-thermodynamic state behavior is attributed to variations in molecular potential energies, which include bond stretching, bond bending, bond torsion, and intra- and intermolecular van der Waals interactions. To unfold the physical representation of extrinsic structural deformation, under the aggressive influence of a shear flow field, the molecular dimension and appearance can be directly described via the squared radius of gyration and the sphericity angle, R(g)(2) and ϕ, respectively. In addition, a specific orientational order S(x) defines the alignment of the molecules with the flow direction of the x-axis. As a result, at low shear rates, the overall molecules are slightly stretched and shaped in a manner that is increasingly ellipsoidal. Simultaneously, there is an obvious enhancement in the order. In contrast to high shear rates, the molecules spontaneously shrink themselves with a decreased value of R(g)(2), while their shape and order barely vary with an infinite value of ϕ and S(x). It is important to note that under different temperatures and pressures, these three parameters are integrated within a molecular description in response to thermodynamic state variable of density and rheological material function of shear viscosity.},

abstract = {The melting of aluminum thin film was studied by a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique. The effect of the grain size and type of confinement was investigated for aluminum film with a constant thickness of 4 nm. The results show that coherent intercrystalline interface suppress the transition of solid aluminum into liquid, while free-surface gives melting point depression. The mechanism of melting of polycrystalline aluminum thin film was investigated. It was found that melting starts at grain boundaries and propagates to grain interiors. The melting point was calculated from the Lindemann index criterion, taking into account only atoms near to grain boundaries. This made it possible to extend melting point calculations to bigger grains, which require a long time (in the MD scale) to be fully molten. The results show that 4 nm thick film of aluminum melts at a temperature lower than the melting point of bulk aluminum (933 K) only when the grain size is reduced to 6 nm.},

A 3D crystal structure in which the interatomic forces between the hydrogen-iron and iron-iron atoms were defined, respectively, by the Morse and modified Morse potential functions was tested numerically. The model and the code developed were applied to a hydrogen-free bcc iron crystal with the mode I crack embedded into the structure and to a bcc iron crystal with the hydrogen atoms aggregated near the crack tip. The influence of hydrogen on the elastic, plastic and fracture behavior of bcc iron crystal has been simulated with nano-scale tensile tests and the stress-strain curves were obtained for the whole deformation process. Simulation results demonstrated that one or two hydrogen atoms placed near the crack tip produced a strong effect on deformation and crack propagation in bcc iron while the effect of additional atoms was insignificant. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The underlying transformation is recorded and investigated by a complementary use of Barkhausen noise measurements, ultrasonic measurements and scanning electron microscopy. While ultrasonic measurements can only be used to detect cracks in a failed component, the recently improved Barkhausen noise measurement technique can be used to detect possible early stages of microstructural transformation. A cross section from a region without ultrasonic signal but with a Barkhausen signal has been investigated by the use of scanning electron microscopes in order to reveal possible pre-stages of WEC formation. These findings support that WEC are locally initiated in subsurface regions. Within those modified regions, carbides start to dissolve in consequence of deformation accumulation, which has been identified as an early state of WEA microstructure formation.},

abstract = {Several methods for preparing well equilibrated melts of long chains polymers are studied. We show that the standard method in which one starts with an ensemble of chains with the correct end-to-end distance arranged randomly in the simulation cell and introduces the excluded volume rapidly, leads to deformation on short length scales. This deformation is strongest for long chains and relaxes only after the chains have moved their own size. Two methods are shown to overcome this local deformation of the chains. One method is to first pre-pack the Gaussian chains, which reduces the density fluctuations in the system, followed by a gradual introduction of the excluded volume. The second method is a double-pivot algorithm in which new bonds are formed across a pair of chains, creating two new chains each substantially different from the original. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods for a linear bead spring polymer model with both zero and nonzero bending stiffness, however the methods are applicable to more complex architectures such as branched and star polymer.},

The precipitation and coarsening of plate-like M4C3 carbides, during the tempering of quaternary Fe-C-Mo-V martensitic steels, has been characterized both experimentally and by developing appropriate kinetic theory. The trapping capacity is found to peak when the carbides are about 10 nm in length, indicating a role of coherency strains in trapping hydrogen atoms via elastic interactions. This suggests a method for developing alloys which are better able to resist the detrimental effects of hydrogen.},

abstract = {This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) approach for induction motor fault diagnosis. The approach utilizes sparse auto-encoder (SAE) to learn features, which belongs to unsupervised feature learning that only requires unlabeled measurement data. With the help of the denoising coding, partial corruption is added into the input of the SAE to improve robustness of feature representation. Features learned from the SAE are then used to train a neural network classifier for identifying induction motor faults. In addition, to prevent overfitting during the training process, a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" which has been proved to be very effective in neural network was employed. An experiment performed on a machine fault simulator indicates that compared with traditional neural network, the SAE-based DNN can achieve superior performance for feature learning and classification in the field of induction motor fault diagnosis.},

We have found that VH2 is the major complex at ambient condition of hydrogen pressure, which corrects the conventional model implying the VH6 predominance. It is also demonstrated that monovacancies are not hindered from binding by the hydrogen trapping in the case of VH2 predominance. Besides, the presence of hydrogen is found to facilitate formations of line-shaped and tabular vacancy clusters without the improbable accumulation. These anisotropic clusters can be closely associated with the fracture planes observed in experiments on hydrogen embrittlement in Fe-rich structural materials such as steel. The present results should suggest implications of hydrogen-enhanced vacancy activities to microscopic mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement in those materials.},

abstract = {A density-functional theory based empirical potential was used to explore the energies of different types of Fe grain boundaries and free surfaces in thermodynamic equilibrium with a hydrogen environment. The classical model for calculating the ideal work of separation with solute atoms is extended to account for every trapping site. This yields the lowest-energy structures at different hydrogen chemical potentials (or gas pressures). At hydrogen gas pressures lower than 1000 atm, the reduction of the reversible work of separation is less than 33{\%} and it increases to 36{\%} at a gas pressure of 5000 atm. Near the hydride formation limit, 5 ?? 104 atm, the reduction is 44{\%}. Based on the magnitude of these reductions for complete decohesion, and accounting for experimental observations of the microstructure associated with hydrogen-induced intergranular fracture of Fe, it is posited that hydrogen-enhanced plasticity and attendant effects establish the local conditions responsible for the transition in fracture mode from transgranular to intergranular. The conclusion is reached that intergranular failure occurs by a reduction of the cohesive energy but with contributions from structural as well as compositional changes in the grain boundary that are driven by hydrogen-enhanced plasticity processes.},

abstract = {Canonical ensemble molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are reported which compute both the vapor-liquid equilibrium properties (vapor pressure and liquid and vapor densities) and the interfacial properties (density profiles, interfacial tensions, entropy and enthalpy of surface formation) of four long-chained n-alkanes: n-decane (n-C(10)), n-eicosane (n-C(20)), n-hexacontane (n-C(60)), and n-decacontane (n-C(100)). Three of the most commonly employed united-atom (UA) force fields for alkanes (SKS: Smit, B.; Karaborni, S.; Siepmann, J. I. J. Chem. Phys. 1995,102, 2126-2140; J. Chem.

B1998, 102, 2569-2577.) are critically appraised. The computed results have been compared to the available experimental data and those fitted using the square gradient theory (SGT). In the latter approach, the Lennard-Jones chain equation of state (EoS), appropriately parametrized for long hydrocarbons, is used to model the homogeneous bulk phase Helmholtz energy. The MD results for phase equilibria of n-decane and n-eicosane exhibit sensible agreement both to the experimental data and EoS correlation for all potentials tested, with the TraPPE potential showing the lowest deviations. However, as the molecular chain increases to n-hexacontane and n-decacontane, the reliability of the UA potentials decreases, showing notorious subpredictions of both saturated liquid density and vapor pressure. Based on the recommended data and EoS results for the heaviest hydrocarbons, it is possible to attest, that in this extreme, the TraPPE potential shows the lowest liquid density deviations. The low absolute values of the vapor pressure preclude the discrimination among the three UA potentials studied. On the other hand, interfacial properties are very sensitive to the type of UA potential thus allowing a differentiation of the potentials. Comparing the interfacial tension MD results to the available experimental data and SGT results, the TraPPE model exhibits the lowest deviations for all hydrocarbons.},

@article{Spikes2014,
abstract = {There is currently considerable debate con- cerning the most appropriate rheological model to describe the behaviour of lubricant films in rolling–sliding, elasto- hydrodynamic contacts. This is an important issue since an accurate model is required to predict friction in such con- tacts. This paper reviews the origins of this debate, which primarily concerns a divergence of views between researchers using high pressure, high shear rate viscometry and those concerned with the measurement and analysis of elastohydrodynamic friction; the former advocate a Car- reau-based shear stress/strain rate model while the latter generally favour an Eyring-based one. The crucial impor- tance of accounting for shear heating effects in analysing both viscometric and friction data is discussed. The main criticisms levied by advocates of a Carreau-based model against Eyring's model are discussed in some detail. Finally, the ability of both types of rheological model to fit elastohydrodynamic friction measurements for a quite simple, well-defined base fluid is tested, using previously measured pressure–viscosity behaviour for the fluid. Both models appear to fit the experimental data over a wide temperature range quite well, though fit of the Eyring model appears slightly closer than that of the Carreau– Yasuda model. Friction data from a wider range of well- defined fluid types are needed to identify categorically the most appropriate model to describe elastohydrodynamic friction.},

abstract = {A scalable parallel algorithm has been designed to study long-time dynamics of many-atom systems based on the nudged elastic band method, which performs mutually constrained molecular dynamics simulations for a sequence of atomic configurations (or states) to obtain a minimum energy path between initial and final local minimum-energy states. A directionally heated nudged elastic band method is introduced to search for thermally activated events without the knowledge of final states, which is then applied to an ensemble of bands in a path ensemble method for long-time simulation in the framework of the transition state theory. The resulting molecular kinetics (MK) simulation method is parallelized with a space-time-ensemble parallel nudged elastic band (STEP-NEB) algorithm, which employs spatial decomposition within each state, while temporal parallelism across the states within each band and band-ensemble parallelism are implemented using a hierarchy of communicator constructs in the Message Passing Interface library. The STEP-NEB algorithm exhibits good scalability with respect to spatial, temporal and ensemble decompositions on massively parallel computers. The MK simulation method is used to study low strain-rate deformation of amorphous silica. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In order to reduce the complexity of the search space the paper presents an approach based on: (i) the representation of the ontological constraints on the compounds' structure in a TBox, and the representation of compound formulations as ABoxes. (ii) The representation of the transitions of a LTS as a set of actions producing updates on ABoxes; (iii) the definition of an algorithm to check ABox consistency with respect to a specific axiom schema in order to prune inconsistent branches of the search space. {\textcopyright} 2007 by Bozen-Bolzano University Press.},

The alloys are characterized by a low carbon content, Mn to obtain different levels of austenite stability, and minor additions of Ni, Ti, and Mo. Hardening in these materials is realized by combining the TRIP effect with a maraging treatment transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), maraging, martensite aging through thermally stimulated precipitation of particles. Four alloys Ni, Co maraging steel and the three maraging TRIP Fe-Mn steels were investigated. These alloys were melted and cast to round billets of 1 Kg each in a vacuum induction furnace. Annealing and swaging of the as-cast alloys was conducted to ensure homogenization of the microstructure and removal of segregation effects. Hardness testing was conducted using a Zwick 3212 hardness tester to determine the Vickers hardness. The TEM and APT results indicate that the steels contain nanosized particles and that the particle dispersion is very high, even after long aging treatment.},

abstract = {During rolling contact fatigue of ball bearings structural changes may occur below the raceway, in the region of maximum shear stress. A great number of 6309 type bearings were tested at two stress levels for varying numbers of revolutions, and the resulting structural changes in the inner rings were studied by optical and electron microscopy. The present observations have been compared to previously reported observations, which are often described in unsystematic terminologies and sometimes apparently contradictory. A unified terminology is worked out, on the basis of which, the structural changes are described. The following features occur, in chronological order. i) A ferritic phase, containing an inhomogeneously distributed excess carbon content, corresponding to that of the parent martensite. A mixture of this phase with residual martensite constitutes the well known dark etching region. ii) Disc-shaped regions of ferrite, thermodynamically stable, about 0.1 $\mu$m thick, inclined by about 30 deg to the raceway, and sandwiched between carbide rich discs. The latter are constituted by very small carbide particles, and are not necessarily compact. iii) A second set of larger disc-shaped regions about 10 $\mu$m thick, of plastically deformed ferrite in thermodynamic equilibrium, forming an angle of about 80 deg to the raceway. Transformation mechanisms are proposed. Particular attention is paid to short range carbon diffusion, induced by the cyclic stresses. {\textcopyright} 1976 The Metallurgical of Society of AIME.},

Focusing on the response of the viscosity, we found that nearly all the shear thinning takes place inside the solid-oligomer interface and that the adsorbed layers are more viscous than the middle part of the films. Moreover, the shear thinning inside the interfacial area is determined by the wall affinity and is largely insensitive to changes of the film thickness and the molecular architecture. The rheological response of the whole film is the weighted average of these two regions -''viscous'' interfacial layer and bulk-like middle part- resulting in an absence of a universal response in the shear thinning regime, in agreement with recent SFA experiments of fluid lubricants.},

abstract = {White etching layer (WEL) is a surface metallurgical feature that is commonly present on rail when it is in service. An investigation of its behaviour under rolling sliding conditions has been conducted within the laboratory using twin disc testing. This has focussed on the rolling contact fatigue behaviour of the rail with the wear of both discs also being discussed. White etching layer has been simulated by spot welding, which creates a patch of martensite by heat treatment, and also by severe plastic deformation of the rail disc. This paper details the numerical results found from the crack growth and wear behaviour of the samples, while the accompanying paper describes the crack morphology. The results show that crack growth is dependant on the subsurface deformation of the pearlite, with longer cracks present for samples with a WEL than for those samples without, for the same number of cycles. The wear of the rail disc with a WEL is much lower than for samples without unless the surface spalls. In contrast, the wear of the wheel disc is much higher than for tests running against a disc without WEL. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {White etching layer (WEL) is a surface metallurgical feature that is commonly present on rail. An investigation of its behaviour under rolling/sliding conditions has been conducted within the laboratory using twin disc testing. This has focussed on the rolling contact fatigue behaviour of the rail, though the wear of both discs is also discussed. White etching layer has been simulated by spot welding, which creates a patch of martensite by heat treatment, and also by severe plastic deformation of the rail disc. This paper details the crack morphology observed under the microscope while the accompanying paper details the numerical results. The results show that crack morphology is dependent on the plastic deformation of the pearlite below the white etching layer. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

All steels exhibited hydrogen sensitivity, manifested by (i) decreased yield strength (by a maximum of 13{\%}) attributed to solid-solution softening by hydrogen, and (ii) reduced ductility (maximum decrease of reduction of area was from 65{\%} to 9{\%}), caused by hydrogen assisted fracture processes after the onset of necking. There was no sub-critical crack growth below the ultimate tensile strength. The hydrogen influence increased with increasing strength, more negative charging potential, and decreasing stress rate.},

Although it has been reported that DER and WEBs typically appear in bearings over extended rolling cycles ({\textgreater}100 × 106) as a result of material deterioration under high-stress RCF while WECs are found to occur in much earlier of bearing's life ({\textless}20{\%} the calculated L10 life), differences and relationship between DER/WEBs and WECs are not fully investigated or understood. This study investigated the microstructural alterations in WECs in an AISI 52100 through-hardened martensitic bearing using a combination of characterisation methods and the results are directly compared with those observed in DER and WEBs due to high-stress RCF ({\v{S}}meļova et al., 2017). The results show that, although the features maybe initiated by different causes, there are many similarities between the microstructural alterations in WECs and DER/WEBs, such as the carbide disintegration, and carbon and chromium movement that plays a role in the formation and development of microstructural alterations in all three features.},

In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed.},

Subsequently, plastic deformation is frequently confined to localized nanoshear bands aligned with the shearing direction and emanating from voids and other defects in the vicinity of the sliding interface.},

@article{Bal2015,
abstract = {The hyperdynamics method is a powerful tool to simulate slow processes at the atomic level. However, the construction of an optimal hyperdynamics potential is a task that is far from trivial. Here, we propose a generally applicable implementation of the hyperdynamics algorithm, borrowing two concepts from metadynamics. First, the use of a collective variable (CV) to represent the accelerated dynamics gives the method a very large flexibility and simplicity. Second, a metadynamics procedure can be used to construct a suitable history-dependent bias potential on-the-fly, effectively turning the algorithm into a self-learning accelerated molecular dynamics method. This collective variable-driven hyperdynamics (CVHD) method has a modular design: both the local system properties on which the bias is based, as well as the characteristics of the biasing method itself, can be chosen to match the needs of the considered system. As a result, system-specific details are abstracted from the biasing algorithm itself, making it extremely versatile and transparent. The method is tested on three model systems: diffusion on the Cu(001) surface and nickel-catalyzed methane decomposition, as examples of ?reactive? processes with a bond-length-based CV, and the folding of a long polymer-like chain, using a set of dihedral angles as a CV. Boost factors up to 109, corresponding to a time scale of seconds, could be obtained while still accurately reproducing correct dynamics.},

We have introduced a fast protocol to prepare well-equilibrated entangled polymer melts of various architectures. A soft, DPD-like potential is used to quickly equilibrate the melt at intermediate length-scale following with a replacement of the DPD potential with Lennard-Jones potential. The equilibrated structure is then subjected to a short MD simulation run that relaxes the melt configuration at the short length-scale. The topological characteristics of the final melt structure are excellent, and the method found to be computationally competitive to other state-of-the-art equilibration techniques. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},

Shear viscosity is calculated using the Green Kubo formula. The force fields are compared with each other using the following criteria: the required time for one molecular dynamics step, the compliance of the main physical and transport properties with experimental values. The problem of the system equilibration is considered. The united-atom potential is used to model the n-triacontane liquid with an initial directional orientation. The time of relaxation to the disordered state, when all molecules orientations are randomized, are obtained. The influence of the molecules orientations on the shear viscosity value and the shear viscosity relaxation are treated.},

abstract = {The application of interval set techniques to the quantification of uncertainty in a neural network regression model of fatigue lifetime is considered. Bayesian evidence training was implemented to train a series of multi-layer perceptron networks on experimental fatigue life measurements in glass fibre composite sandwich materials. A set of independent measurements conducted 2 months after the training session, and at intermediate fatigue loading levels, was used to provide a rigorous test of the generalisation capacity of the networks. The robustness of the networks to uncertainty in the input data was investigated using an interval-based technique. It is demonstrated that the interval approach allowed for an alternative to probabilistic-based confidence bounds of prediction accuracy. In addition, the technique provided an alternative network selection tool, and also allowed for an alternative to estimating the lifetime prediction error that was found to be a significant improvement over the Bayesian-derived estimate of confidence bound. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These ab initio models, involving no experimental input parameters, appear to be as quantitatively accurate and informative as the most advanced experimental techniques developed for the observation of radiation damage phenomena. Density functional theory models have effectively created a new paradigm for the scientific investigation and assessment of radiation damage effects, offering new insight into the origin of temperature- and dose-dependent response of materials to irradiation, a problem of pivotal significance for applications.},

abstract = {Due to its high diffusivity, hydrogen is often considered a weak inhibitor or even a promoter of dislocation movements in metals and alloys. By quantitative mechanical tests in an environmental transmission electron microscope, here we demonstrate that after exposing aluminium to hydrogen, mobile dislocations can lose mobility, with activating stress more than doubled. On degassing, the locked dislocations can be reactivated under cyclic loading to move in a stick-slip manner. However, relocking the dislocations thereafter requires a surprisingly long waiting time of approximately 103 s, much longer than that expected from hydrogen interstitial diffusion. Both the observed slow relocking and strong locking strength can be attributed to superabundant hydrogenated vacancies, verified by our atomistic calculations. Vacancies therefore could be a key plastic flow localization agent as well as damage agent in hydrogen environment.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic guided waves (UGWs) are a useful tool in structural health monitoring (SHM) applications that can benefit from built-in transduction, moderately large inspection ranges, and high sensitivity to small flaws. This paper describes an SHM method based on UGWs and outlier analysis devoted to the detection and quantification of fatigue cracks in structural waveguides. The method combines the advantages of UGWs with the outcomes of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract defect-sensitive features aimed at performing a multivariate diagnosis of damage. In particular, the DWT is exploited to generate a set of relevant wavelet coefficients to construct a uni-dimensional or multi-dimensional damage index vector. The vector is fed to an outlier analysis to detect anomalous structural states. The general framework presented in this paper is applied to the detection of fatigue cracks in a steel beam. The probing hardware consists of a National Instruments PXI platform that controls the generation and detection of the ultrasonic signals by means of piezoelectric transducers made of lead zirconate titanate. The effectiveness of the proposed approach to diagnose the presence of defects as small as a few per cent of the waveguide cross-sectional area is demonstrated.},

These additional types of information were incorporated to ensure more reasonable descriptions of atomic interactions at small separations than is provided using standard approaches, such as fitting to the universal binding energy relation.

Measurements are made on four tetrafunctional end-linked networks having molecular weights of 2 x 10(3), 5 x 10(3), 10 x 10(3), and 23 x 10(3) between junctions. Results of experiments are compared with predictions of calculations based on (i) the widely used Kuhn expression and (ii) the rotational isomeric state formalism. The Kuhn expression is found to considerably overestimate the segmental orientation of the PDMS chains. The rotational isomeric state approach leads to values of segmental orientation that fall between predictions of the affine and phantom network models. This indicates that nematic-like intermolecular contributions to orientation are not significant.},

In this paper, the energetics of small hydrogen-vacancy clusters in body centered cubic iron are investigated. Results from two interatomic potentials are compared. We use molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods to find the minimum energy configurations of voids of up to ten vacancies containing up to 50 hydrogen atoms with ratios of hydrogen to vacancy of 10 or less. The formation energies and binding energies of defects to these clusters are calculated. Our results indicate that the hydrogen stabilizes bubbles by causing vacancies to be more tightly bound to clusters, while neighboring irons are less tightly bound. Hydrogen itself becomes less well bound to clusters as the inventory increases. The more physically relevant potential indicates a maximum supported ratio of hydrogen atoms to vacancies of about 4.},

abstract = {By using molecular dynamics and cluster dynamics simulations, we probed the role of hydrogen-vacancy complexes on nucleation and growth of proto nano-voids upon dislocation plasticity in ??-Fe. Our atomistic simulations reveal that, unlike a lattice vacancy, a hydrogen-vacancy complex is not absorbed by dislocations sweeping through the lattice. Additionally, this complex has lower lattice diffusivity; therefore, it has a lower probability of encountering and being absorbed by various lattice sinks. Hence, it can exist metastably for a rather long time. Our large-scale molecular dynamics simulations show that when metals undergo plastic deformation in the presence of hydrogen at low homologous temperatures, the mechanically driven out-of-equilibrium dislocation processes can produce extremely high concentrations of hydrogen-vacancy complex (10-5 ??? 10-3). Under such high concentrations, these complexes prefer to grow by absorbing additional vacancies and act as the embryos for the formation of proto nano-voids. The current work provides one possible route for the experimentally observed nano-void formation in hydrogen embrittlement of steels and bridges atomic-scale events and damage with macroscopic failure.},

The single-crystal elastic constants are derived from the total energies of distorted structures. For the thermal expansion, the contribution of electronic states is determined within a free-electron model utilizing the density of states at the Fermi energy of the actual materials. The contribution of lattice vibrations to the thermal properties is modelled by Debye's approximation for phonon dispersion. Anharmonic effects are included via Griineisen's theory requiring the volume dependence of the Debye temperature. For the calculation of the Gruneisen parameter, volume- and pressure-dependent single-crystal elastic constants are needed. Since in reality refractory compounds always contain vacancies, the influence of vacancies is studied for vanadium carbides by a supercell of composition VCo 75. It is found that vacancies significantly increase the thermal expansion coefficient, in particular at higher temperatures. Because of the modelling procedure, third derivatives of first-principles total energies are needed, which requires a high-quality method as well as a thorough application of it. The accuracy of the calculated values as well as their agreement with the rather sparse experimental data is discussed.},

abstract = {Point defects in Fe and dilute FeCu alloys are investigated by ab initio calculations based on density functional theory. The relaxed vacancy and interstitial and substitutional Cu atom formation energies are determined as well as some migration energies. The binding energies of various Cu containing defects believed to play an important role in the embrittlement of pressure vessel steels under radiation are calculated and discussed. The results are consistent with a Cu transport via a vacancy mechanism. The introduction of a Cu atom decreases the energy difference between the 110 dumbbell and the 111 dumbbell configurations, and should make the dumbbell rotation motion easier. The ab initio results are compared to the figures obtained with empirical interatomic potentials. The convergence of the results with the simulated system size is examined.},

In this paper, the influence of test time (180, 500, 1000 and 2500h) on the formation and characteristics of tribolayers in pairs of DLC-stainless steel that were tested under an atmosphere of refrigerant gas R134a and without lubricating oil was analyzed. The characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) (morphology and chemical composition) and white light interferometry (thickness). The tribolayer thicknesses ranged from 100 to 500nm, and they were composed of elements originating from mutual transfers between the tribological pairs, as well as oxides that were more pronounced on the stainless steel surface. The results show that the tribolayers are chemically stable, maintaining the same composition over time, and their thicknesses remained constant after 1000h of testing.},

abstract = {We present molecular dynamics friction calculations for confined hydrocarbon solids with molecular lengths from 20 to 1400 carbon atoms. Two cases are considered: a) polymer sliding against a hard substrate, and b) polymer sliding on polymer. In the first setup the shear stresses are relatively independent of molecular length. For polymer sliding on polymer the friction is significantly larger, and dependent on the molecular chain length. In both cases, the shear stresses are proportional to the squeezing pressure and finite at zero load, indicating an adhesional contribution to the friction force. The friction decreases when the sliding distance is of the order of the molecular length indicating a strong influence of molecular alignment during run-in. The results of our calculations show good correlation with experimental work.},

The atomic interactions are described by the all-atom "Optimized Potentials for Liquid Simulations" (OPLS-AA). In this paper we: first assess the use of OPLS-AA in our models, especially using NBR bulk properties, and second evaluate the validity of the proposed model for HNBR by investigating mass density and glass transition as a function of the tunable cross-link density. Experimental densities are reproduced within 3{\%} for both elastomers, and qualitatively correct trends in the glass transition temperature as a function of the monomer composition and cross-link density are obtained.},

The signals were processed to obtain various statistical parameters, which are good indicators of bearing condition, and these inputs were used to train the neural network and the output represented the ball bearing states. The trained neural networks were used for the recognition of ball bearing states. The results showed that the trained neural networks were able to distinguish a normal bearing from defective bearings with 100{\%} reliability. Moreover, the networks were able to classify the ball bearings into different states with success rates better than those achieved with the best among the state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANN) are extensively utilized in structural health monitoring. Nevertheless, the definition of a rigorous method for the optimization of their structure is still an unresolved issue, especially when applied to safety critical systems. In this paper, an approach typically adopted in the design of experiments and based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to statistically determine the number of hidden neurons in a three-layer ANN structure. Repeated trainings of the same network structure provide multiple observations of the performance index here, based on the root mean square error. Different levels of network structure complexity are statistically compared, based on the number of hidden nodes. ANOVA is used to determine whether there is statistical evidence that the network performance is influenced by the number of hidden nodes. This analysis allows defining the threshold number of hidden nodes above which there is no statistical evidence of a performance benefit by the increase of the ANN structure complexity. The method is applied to the optimization of a set of algorithms for the diagnosis of fatigue damage on a typical aeronautical structure, consisting of a metallic panel with a riveted skin-stringer construction. The ANNs for damage detection, localization, and quantification are trained and validated with finite element simulated strain data and are finally tested on experimental strain signals, acquired in real-time in a fatigue crack growth laboratory test program including a skin crack artificially initiated in a panel bay and two stringers that had failed naturally under fatigue load.},

We find that upon rolling contact loading the original plate-like martensitic structure evolves into a nanosized equiaxed grain structure with C segregation up to 5 at.-{\%} at the grain boundaries. Cementite particles, located at grain boundaries and triple junctions, undergo spheroidisation. The originally homogeneously distributed Cr becomes enriched in spheroidised cementite particles.

abstract = {There has long existed a controversy regarding the formation of the bainite phase in steels. Nonetheless, following the clear identification of bainite in 1930, several characteristic features associated with the bai- nite transformation became well established. These features include: the classification into upper and lower bainite; the existence of a bainite-start temperature; and the incomplete-reaction phenomenon. Accordingly, two competing theories have been developed to explain the bainite transformation. However, no overriding consensus has been reached as to which is correct. The first theory invokes a diffusion-controlled transformation, describing the growth of bainite via the propagation of ‘ledges' — a series of steps on the transformation interface. The second interpretation favours a displacive, diffusionless transformation. Bainite growth occurs via the autocatalytic nucleation and growth of successive sub-units or platelets. Over time, a wealth of techniques has been implemented in order to in- crease the understanding of the mechanism by which bainite forms. From the early approaches that involved thermodynamic and kinetic considerations; through detailed work on the crystallography of the transforma- tion; to studies involving advanced characterisation techniques that focused on the distribution of atoms, etc. Some of the theories have been progressively adapted to new evidence and new concepts as they emerge. For example: the concepts of the T0 curve and of paraequilibrium transformation.},

abstract = {Equilibrated systems of entangled polymer melts cannot be produced using direct brute force equilibration due to the slow reptation dynamics exhibited by high molecular weight chains. Instead, these dense systems are produced using computational techniques such as Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics hybrid algorithms, though the use of soft potentials has also shown promise mainly for coarse-grained polymeric systems. Through the use of soft-potentials, the melt can be equilibrated via molecular dynamics at intermediate and long length scales prior to switching to a Lennard-Jones potential.We will outline two different equilibration protocols, which use various degrees of informa- tion to produce the starting configurations. In one protocol, we use only the equilibrium bond angle, bond length, and target density during the construction of the simulation cell, where the information is obtained from available experimental data and extracted from the force field without performing any prior simulation. In the second protocol, we moreover utilize the equilibrium radial distribution function and dihedral angle distribution. This information can be obtained from experimental data or from a simulation of short unentangled chains. Both methods can be used to prepare equilibrated and highly entangled systems, but the second protocol is much more computationally efficient. These systems can be strictly monodisperse or optionally polydisperse depending on the starting chain distribution. Our protocols, which utilize a soft-core harmonic potential, will be applied for the first time to equilibrate a million particle system of polyethylene chains consisting of 1000 united atoms at various temperatures. Calculations of structural and entanglement properties demonstrate that this method can be used as an alternative towards the generation of entangled equilibrium structures},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations, with the interaction between atoms described by a modified analytic embedded atom method, have been performed to obtain the atomic-scale details of isothermal melting in nanocrystalline Ag and crystallization from supercooled liquid. The radial distribution function and common neighbor analysis provide a visible scenario of structural evolution in the process of phase transition. The results indicate that melting at a fixed temperature in nanocrystalline materials is a continuous process, which originates from the grain boundary network. With the melting developing, the characteristic bond pairs (555), (433), and (544), existing in liquid or liquidlike phase, increase approximately linearly till completely melted. The crystallization from supercooled liquid is characterized by three characteristic stages: nucleation, rapid growth of nucleus, and slow structural relaxation. The homogeneous nucleation occurs at a larger supercooling temperature, which has an important effect on the process of crystallization and the subsequent crystalline texture. The kinetics of transition from liquid to solid is well described by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami equation.},

It is commonly assumed that, once defect clusters nucleate, their structure remains essentially constant while they grow in size. Here, we describe a new mechanism, discovered during accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of vacancy clusters in fcc metals, that involves the direct transformation of a vacancy void to a stacking fault tetrahedron (SFT) through a series of 3D structures. This mechanism is in contrast with the collapse to a 2D Frank loop which then transforms to an SFT. The kinetics of this mechanism are characterized by an extremely large rate prefactor, tens of orders of magnitude larger than is typical of atomic processes in fcc metals.},

The prominent features of the band structures for WC are a particularly wide 5d W, 2p C band, and also the presence of a separate 5d W band below the Fermi level. The values of the lattice constants, bulk moduli, sound velocities, Debye temperatures and melting temperatures have been calculated and are in reasonable agreement with experiment. It is shown that the high values of the bulk moduli of VC and NbC are explained by the hybridization between s- and p-metal states and 2s C, 2p C states, while the extreme value of the modulus for WC is due mainly to the covalency resulting from 5d W, 2s C and 2p C hybridization. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {A novel data-model-fusion prognostic framework is developed in this paper to improve the accuracy of system state long-horizon forecasting. This framework strategically integrates the strengths of the data-driven prognostic method and the model-based particle filtering approach in system state prediction while alleviating their limitations. In the proposed methodology, particle filtering is applied for system state estimation in parallel with parameter identification of the prediction model (with unknown parameters) based on Bayesian learning. Simultaneously, a data-driven predictor is employed to learn the system degradation pattern from history data so as to predict system evolution (or future measurements). An innovative feature of the proposed fusion prognostic framework is that the predicted measurements (with uncertainties) from the data-driven predictor will be properly managed and utilized by the particle filtering to further update the prediction model parameters, thereby enabling markedly better prognosis as well as improved forecasting transparency. As an application example, the developed fusion prognostic framework is employed to predict the remaining useful life of lithium ion batteries through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy tests. The investigation results demonstrate that the proposed fusion prognostic framework is an effective forecasting tool that can integrate the strengths of both the data-driven method and the particle filtering approach to achieve more accurate state forecasting. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract  A generalization of the original peridynamic framework for solid mechanics is proposed. This generalization permits the response$\backslash$nof a material at a point to depend collectively on the deformation of all bonds connected to the point. This extends the types$\backslash$nof material response that can be reproduced by peridynamic theory to include an explicit dependence on such collectively determined$\backslash$nquantities as volume change or shear angle. To accomplish this generalization, a mathematical object called a deformation state is defined, a function that maps any bond onto its image under the deformation. A similar object called a force state is defined, which contains the forces within bonds of all lengths and orientation. The relation between the deformation state$\backslash$nand force state is the constitutive model for the material. In addition to providing a more general capability for reproducing$\backslash$nmaterial response, the new framework provides a means to incorporate a constitutive model from the conventional theory of$\backslash$nsolid mechanics directly into a peridynamic model. It also allows the condition of plastic incompressibility to be enforced$\backslash$nin a peridynamic material model for permanent deformation analogous to conventional plasticity theory.},

abstract = {By using molecular dynamics and cluster dynamics simulations, we probed the role of hydrogen-vacancy complexes on nucleation and growth of proto nano-voids upon dislocation plasticity in $\alpha$-Fe. Our atomistic simulations reveal that, unlike a lattice vacancy, a hydrogen-vacancy complex is not absorbed by dislocations sweeping through the lattice. Additionally, this complex has lower lattice diffusivity; therefore, it has a lower probability of encountering and being absorbed by various lattice sinks. Hence, it can exist metastably for a rather long time. Our large-scale molecular dynamics simulations show that when metals undergo plastic deformation in the presence of hydrogen at low homologous temperatures, the mechanically driven out-of-equilibrium dislocation processes can produce extremely high concentrations of hydrogen-vacancy complex (10-5 ∼ 10-3). Under such high concentrations, these complexes prefer to grow by absorbing additional vacancies and act as the embryos for the formation of proto nano-voids. The current work provides one possible route for the experimentally observed nano-void formation in hydrogen embrittlement of steels and bridges atomic-scale events and damage with macroscopic failure.},

abstract = {In the Internet-of-Things environment, it is critical to bridge the gap between business decisionmaking and real-time factory data to let companies transfer from condition-based maintenance service to predictive maintenance service. Condition monitoring systems have been widely applied to many industries to acquire operation and equipment related data, through which machine health state can be evaluated. One of the challenges of predicting future machine health lies in extracting the right features that are correlated well with the fault progression / degradation. We propose an enhanced Restricted Boltzmann Machine with a novel regularization term to automatically generate features that are suitable for remaining useful life prediction. The regularization term tries to maximize the trendability of the output features, which potentially better represent the degradation pattern of a system. The proposed method is benchmarked with regular restricted Boltzmann machine algorithm and principal component analysis. The generated features are used as input to a similarity-based method for life prediction. Run-to-failure datasets collected from two rotating systems are used for validation.},

abstract = {An improved way of estimating the local tangent in the nudged elastic band method for finding minimum energy paths is presented. In systems where the force along the minimum energy path is large compared to the restoring force perpendicular to the path and when many images of the system are included in the elastic band, kinks can develop and prevent the band from converging to the minimum energy path. We show how the kinks arise and present an improved way of estimating the local tangent which solves the problem. The task of finding an accurate energy and configuration for the saddle point is also discussed and examples given where a complementary method, the dimer method, is used to efficiently converge to the saddle point. Both methods only require the first derivative of the energy and can, therefore, easily be applied in plane wave based density-functional theory calculations. Examples are given from studies of the exchange diffusion mechanism in a Si crystal, Al addimer formation on the Al(100) surface, and dissociative adsorption of CH 4 on an Ir(111) surface.},

abstract = {Recent simulations and experiments have probed dry and lubricated friction between atomically flat surfaces. The behavior in these molecular-scale bearings is often strikingly different than that in their macroscopic counterparts. For example, dry contacts usually do not exhibit static friction, while “lubricated” contacts may. These results are summarized, and possible origins for the differences between microscopic and macroscopic behavior are suggested. For example, static friction in dry sliding may result either from disorder, or from the presence of “third bodies” between the two surfaces. Both effects are generaly minimized in molecular-scale studies. The unusual behavior in molecularly thin lubricant films is related to confinement-induced phase transitions. These may be closely related to pressure-induced transitions in macroscopic lubricant films.},

abstract = {Global optimization of transition paths in complex atomic scale systems is addressed in the context of misfit dislocation formation in a strained Ge film on Si(001). Such paths contain multiple intermediate minima connected by minimum energy paths on the energy surface emerging from the atomic interactions in the system. The challenge is to find which intermediate states to include and to construct a path going through these intermediates in such a way that the overall activation energy for the transition is minimal. In the numerical approach presented here, intermediate minima are constructed by heredity transformations of known minimum energy structures and by identifying local minima in minimum energy paths calculated using a modified version of the nudged elastic band method. Several mechanisms for the formation of a 90° misfit dislocation at the Ge–Si interface are identified when this method is used to construct transition paths connecting a homogeneously strained Ge film and a film containing a misfit dislocation. One of these mechanisms which has not been reported in the literature is detailed. The activation energy for this path is calculated to be 26{\%} smaller than the activation energy for half loop formation of a full, isolated 60° dislocation. An extension of the common neighbor analysis method involving characterization of the geometrical arrangement of second nearest neighbors is used to identify and visualize the dislocations and stacking faults.},

Firstly, multiple vibration signals are acquainted from various fault bearings. Secondly, some time-domain characteristics are extracted from original signals of each individual sensor. Finally, the features data of all sensors are put into the DBN and generate an appropriate classifier to complete fault diagnosis. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of multivibration signals, experiments are carried out on the individual sensor with the same conditions and procedure. At the same time, the method is compared with SVM, KNN, and BPNN methods. The results show that the DBN-based method is able to not only adaptively fuse multisensor data, but also obtain higher identification accuracy than other methods.},

However, hydrogen embrittlement in steels - iron based alloys - is an important issue related to the safety of our infrastructure, such as railroads and bridges. Therefore, the prevention of hydrogen embrittlement in steels is necessary. In the present study, we demonstrate two novel methods for the prevention of hydrogen embrittlement in iron: one involves the low-energy implantation of helium, which is usually an element harmful to metals, into iron, the other is inducing damage to the iron surface by ion irradiation. In general, irradiation with high-energy particles leads to metal brittleness. In the former method, the driving force for hydrogen embrittlement in iron is weakened, in the latter method, hydrogen diffusion in iron is prevented because of trapping of hydrogen atoms in the vacancies produced by the irradiation. As a result, hydrogen embrittlement in iron was suppressed by both methods.},

abstract = {For over a century, rolling contact fatigue in bearings has been recognised as a key feature limiting bearing life. The phenomenon is manifested through dark etching regions, 30 and 80 degrees white etching bands as well as white etching areas, the latter often forming intricate defects commonly referred to as butterflies. Their presence depends on testing conditions, such as contact pressure, temperature, number of revolutions and steel cleanliness. Microstructural inspection demonstrates that precipitate shearing, dissolution, cell and nanocrystal formation as well as matrix/inclusion debonding may take place throughout bearing life. Such microstructural features have a negative effect on bearing hardness, strength, ductility and toughness, usually preceding failure. The present review shows how such phenomena are interconnected, highlighting the need for integral characterisation and modelling across the scales. This will aid in the conception of new heat treatments, steel grades and microstructures for enhanced rolling contact fatigue, leading to increased bearing life.},

abstract = {Broadening functionality of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques shows that they are very useful computational intelligence methods. In the present study the potential of various artificial intelligence techniques to predict and analyze the damage is investigated. Pre-treated experimental data was used to determine the wear of contacting surfaces as a criterion of damage that can be useful for a life-time prediction. The benefit of acquired knowledge can be crucial for the industrial expert systems and the scientific feature extraction that cannot be underestimated. Wear is a very complex and partially formalized phenomenon involving numerous parameters and damage mechanisms. To correlate the working conditions with the state of contacting bodies and to define damage mechanisms different techniques are used. Neural network structures are implemented to learn from experimental data, genetic programming to find a formula describing the wear volume and fuzzy inference system to impose physically meaningful rules. To gain data for the creation and verification of the model, experiments were conducted on commonly used chromium steel under dry and base oil bath-lubricated fretting test apparatus. Decisive factors for a comparison of used AI techniques are their: performance, generalization capabilities, complexity and time-consumption. Optimization of the structure of the model is done to reach high robustness of field applications. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Substantial microstructural changes have been found to occur in bearing steels when subjected to high stress Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) and have been mainly reported in literature between the 1940s and 1990s. However, owing to limitations in the characterisation techniques available at the time, inconsistent interpretation and use of discrepant terminology have caused considerable difficulties in defining the microstructural changes accurately and unambiguously. In the present work, we have investigated the typical microstructural alterations, including Dark Etching Region (DER), Low Angle Bands (LABs) and High Angle Bands (HABs), and their formation mechanisms in RCF failed AISI 52100 (100Cr6) bearing steels using a combination of advanced microstructure characterisation techniques, including Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) coupled with Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and nanohardness measurements. Based on this combined approach, we are now able to give detailed insight in the plasticity-induced transformation and degradation mechanisms during high-stress RCF. The results show that new globular and elongated grains with distinct textures form during all stages of RCF, however a redistribution of chemical elements was only observed during the later stages of RCF. This has provided a significant insight in the formation mechanisms of DER, LABs and HABs. A model of the sequence of microstructure alterations during RCF is thus been proposed based on the findings.},

In particular, interfaces between WEA and retained austenite or spherodized carbide in a high carbon chromium bearing steel have been observed. Fatigue tests were carried out by means of a disk on roller-type equipment. It was found that acicular structures are formed at an initial stage of the WEA formation process. Plastic deformations of spherodized carbides were caused by shear stress in the initial stage of this process as well. Additionally, micro voids were found near the interfaces. Furthermore, amorphous-like structures were found in the WEA. It was suggested that WEA formation is caused by the local plastic deformation of the material. The shear stress was caused by slipping between the roller and the disk. As a result, it was suggested that martensite forms an amorphous-like phase and then changes into a WEA. Cracks developed in the amorphous-like structure/the granular area interface in the WEA and in the Matrix/WEA interface.},

abstract = {Diffusivity in defected crystals depends strongly on the interactions among vacancies and interstitials. Here we present atomistic analyses of point-defect cluster (PDC) concentrations and their kinetic barriers to diffusion in ferritic or body-centered-cubic (bcc) iron supersaturated with carbon. Among all possible point-defect species, only monovacancies, divacancies, and the PDC containing one vacancy and two carbon atoms are found to be statistically abundant. We find that the migration barriers of these vacancy-carbon PDCs are sufficiently high compared to that of monovacancies and divacancies. This leads to decreased self-diffusivity in bcc Fe with increasing carbon content for any given vacancy concentration, which becomes negligible when the local interstitial carbon concentration approaches twice that of free vacancies. These results contrast with trends observed in fcc Fe and provide a plausible explanation for the experimentally observed carbon dependence of volume diffusion-mediated creep in ferritic (bcc) Fe-C alloys. Moreover, this approach represents a general framework to predict self-diffusivity in alloys comprising a spectrum of point-defect clusters based on an energy-landscape survey of local energy minima (formation energies governing concentrations) and saddle points (activation barriers governing mobility).},

As a starting point, we focus on the near-surface region of an axial thrust bearing, made of martensitic 100Cr6 steel, to study the influence of rolling contact loading on the microstructure and the resulting distributions of the major alloying elements C and Cr using atom probe tomography. We find that upon rolling contact loading the original plate-like martensitic structure evolves into a nanosized equiaxed grain structure with C segregation up to 5 at.-{\%} at the grain boundaries. Cementite particles, located at grain boundaries and triple junctions, undergo spheroidisation. The originally homogeneously distributed Cr becomes enriched in spheroidised cementite particles.

@article{Sivebaek2010,
abstract = {We present molecular dynamics friction calculations for confined hydrocarbon "polymer" solids with molecular lengths from 20 to 1400 carbon atoms. Two cases are considered: (a) polymer sliding against a hard substrate and (b) polymer sliding on polymer. We discuss the velocity dependence of the frictional shear stress for both cases. In our simulations, the polymer films are very thin (approximately 3 nm), and the solid walls are connected to a thermostat at a short distance from the polymer slab. Under these circumstances we find that frictional heating effects are not important, and the effective temperature in the polymer film is always close to the thermostat temperature. In the first setup (a), for hydrocarbons with molecular lengths from 60 to 1400 carbon atoms, the shear stresses are nearly independent of molecular length, but for the shortest hydrocarbon C(20)H(42) the frictional shear stress is lower. In all cases the frictional shear stress increases monotonically with the sliding velocity. For polymer sliding on polymer (case b) the friction is much larger, and the velocity dependence is more complex. For hydrocarbons with molecular lengths from 60 to 140 C atoms, the number of monolayers of lubricant increases (abruptly) with increasing sliding velocity (from 6 to 7 layers), leading to a decrease of the friction. Before and after the layering transition, the frictional shear stresses are nearly proportional to the logarithm of sliding velocity. For the longest hydrocarbon (1400 C atoms) the friction shows no dependence on the sliding velocity, and for the shortest hydrocarbon (20 C atoms) the frictional shear stress increases nearly linearly with the sliding velocity.},

abstract = {It is now well-established that the liquid adjacent to a solid need not be stationary – it can slip. How this slip occurs is unclear. We present molecular-dynamics (MD) simulation data and results from an analytical model which support two mechanisms of slip. At low levels of forcing, the potential field generated by the solid creates a ground state which the liquid atoms preferentially occupy. Liquid atoms hop through this energy landscape from one equilibrium site to another according to Arrhenius dynamics. Visual evidence of the trajectories of individual atoms on the solid surface supports the view of localized hopping, independent of the dynamics outside a local neighbourhood. We call this defect slip. At higher levels of forcing, the entire layer slips together, obviating the need for localized defects and resulting in the instantaneous motion of all atoms adjacent to the solid. The appearance of global slip leads to an increase in the number of slipping atoms and consequently an increase in the slip length. Both types of slip observed in the MD simulations are described by a dynamical model in which each liquid atom experiences a force from its neighbouring liquid atoms and the solid atoms of the boundary, is sheared by the overlying liquid, and damped by the solid. In agreement with the MD observations, this model predicts that above a critical value of forcing, localized slipping occurs in which atoms are driven from low-energy sites, but only if there is a downstream site which has been vacated. Also as observed, above a second critical value, all the liquid atoms adjacent to the wall slip. Finally, the dynamical equation predicts that at extremely large values of forcing, the slip length approaches a constant value, in agreement with the MD simulation results.},

The proposed model is capable of predicting the progress of DER formation and the corresponding mechanical property evolution with increasing number of cycles, in good agreement with the experimental data reported throughout seventy years. The effects of RCF testing conditions on DER formation are studied and a useful tool, DER{\%} maps, is developed for illustrating the temperature, contact pressure and number of cycles for DER occurrence. Moreover, an atom probe tomography study is carried out, revealing the nature of DER ferrite and obtaining strong evidence supporting the postulated DER formation mechanism. The successful application of the dislocation assisted carbon migration mechanism to DER formation provides a plausible explanation to the phenomenon of martensite decay under rolling contact fatigue.},

abstract = {In order to perform a systematic study of the interaction between grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations using molecular dynamics (MD), several tools need to be available. A combination of computational geometry and MD was used to build the foundations of what we call a virtual laboratory. First, an algorithm to generate GBs on face-centered cubic bicrystals was developed. Two crystals with different orientations are placed together. Then, by applying "microscopic" rigid body translations along the GB plane to one of the crystals and removing overlapping atoms, a set of initial configurations is sampled and a minimum energy configuration is found. Second, to classify the geometry of the GBs a local symmetry type (LST) describing the angular environment of each atom is calculated. It is found that for a given relaxed GB the number of atoms with different LSTs is not very large and that it is possible to find unique geometrical patterns in each GB. For instance, the LSTs of two GBs having the same "macroscopic" configuration but different "microscopic" degrees of freedom can be dissimilar: the configurations with higher GB energy tend to have a higher number of atoms with different LSTs. Third, edge dislocations are introduced into the bicrystals. We see that full edge dislocations split into Shockley partials. Finally, by loading the bicrystals with tensile stresses the edge dislocations are put into motion. Various examples of dislocation-GB interactions in Cu are presented.},

By rapidly freezing a shearing film followed by splitting (cleaving) the films from the confining mica substrate surfaces, it was possible to obtain AFM images of the structures of the films during steady-state sliding, revealing striped domains approximately 2 A in height and a few nanometer wide whose structure depends on the sliding velocity and, most likely, also on the sliding distance and time. In contrast, confined but unsheared films yielded completely featureless images. To the best of our knowledge, the results are the first direct experimental measurement of shear-induced ordering in nano-confined films resulting in layering and domain formation, but any molecular-level alignment, if present, could not be established.},

abstract = {The nucleation and growth of lenticular carbides (LCs) in bearing steels occur near to deformed ferrite bands after exposure to prolonged rolling contact fatigue (RCF). Since the first observations in 1947, a large number of attempts have been made to explain the formation mechanisms of such stress-induced microstructural alterations, but a reliable model was still not available. In this research, a novel theory is proposed to describe the carbon redistribution process during LC formation. The theory suggests a dislocation assisted LC growth mechanism on the basis of the classic Cottrell atmosphere formation theory. The mechanism considers (1) JLC=Jd, the carbon flux equilibrium between LC thickening (JLC) and dislocation-assisted carbon migration (Jd), and (2) M0=MLC+Mb, the carbon mass conservation of the system, where M0 denotes the total amount of carbon within the system, MLC denotes the amount of carbon within a LC, and Mb denotes the amount of carbon left within the ferrite band, respectively. The solution to these two equations, which addresses the problem that has been puzzling researchers for several decades, makes good predictions on LC thickening rate under various testing conditions. The stress-induced carbide precipitation was examined using high resolution characterisation techniques such as scanning and transmission electron microscopy, obtaining significant evidence to support the postulated theory. The successful description of LC growth implies a potential extension of the theory to other types of stress induced microstructural changes in bearing steels where carbon redistribution occurs. The model presented here provides a more comprehensive understanding of RCF from a microstructural point of view, and thus can enhance the accuracy of traditional bearing life prediction approaches.},

The estimations are embedded within an optimal policy of condition-based component replacement, in which both replacement upon failure and preventive replacement are considered, and the decision variable is the expected cost per unit time. An application is reported with regards to a component subject to fatigue degradation, modeled by the well-known Paris-Erdogan law. The possibility of predicting accurately the component remaining life with the associated uncertainty and of updating the prediction on the basis of observations of the degradation process, opens the door for effective condition-based replacement planning and risk-informed life-extension for hazardous technologies, such as the nuclear, aerospace and chemical ones. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The shear forces between 2 molecularly smooth solid surfaces operated by thin films of various org. liqs. were measured to det. the nature of the transitions from continuum to mol. behavior in very thin films. For films whose thickness is {\textgreater}10 mol. diams., both their static and dynamic behavior usually can be described in terms of their bulk properties, but for thinner films their behavior becomes progressively more solidlike and can no longer be described, even qual., in terms of bulk/continuum properties such as viscosity. The solidlike state is characterized by the ordering of the liq. mols. into discrete layers. The mol. ordering is further modified by shear, which imposes a preferred orientation. All solidlike films exhibit a yield point or crit. shear stress, beyond which they behave like liq. crystals or ductile solids undergoing plastic deformation. Results for 5 liqs. of different mol. geometry reveal some very complex thin-film properties, such as the quantization of various static and dynamic properties, discontinuous or continuous solid-liq. transitions, smooth or stick-slip friction, and 2-dimensional nucleation. Quant., the "effective" viscosity in molecularly thin films can be 105 times the bulk value, and mol. relaxation times can be 1010 times slower. These properties depend not only on the nature of the liq., but also on the at. structure of the surfaces, the normal pressure, and the direction and velocity of sliding. Many thin-film properties depend on there being 2 surfaces close together and that they cannot be understood from a consideration of a single solid-liq. interface. The results provide new fundamental insights into the states of thin films, and have a bearing on understanding boundary friction, thin-film lubrication and the stress-strain properties of solids at the mol. level.},

For weak wall-fluid interactions there is little ordering and slip was observed. At large interactions, substantial epitaxial ordering was induced and the first one or two fluid layers became locked to the wall.

abstract = {There has been a great deal of work on the formation of hard white-etching regions in conventional bearing steels such as 1C-1.5Cr wt{\%} when subjected repeatedly to rolling contact stresses. The regions are a consequence of localised mechanical attrition across microcrack faces and mixing, which refine the local structure and force cementite to dissolve. This white-etching matter is often associated with brittle phenomena because the hardness can exceed 1100 HV. In contrast, carbide-free mixtures of bainitic ferrite and retained austenite when subjected to the same loading have been unexpectedly found not to develop the characteristic patches of hard material and to show instead signs of ductility in the attrited regions. The work presented here shows that the white-etching areas that develop in carbide-free bainite are softer than their surroundings, whether they are in hard nanostructured bainite destined for bearing applications or when the steel is designed for the manufacture of rails. Advanced characterisation tools were used for the first time to understand carbon redistribution during its formation. The deep interest about soft white-etching matter originates from the idea that it could lead to the reduction in premature failure of wind turbine gearbox bearings and white-etching layer grinding of rails.},

abstract = {By combining shear rate range data in engine components with measured viscosity shear rate curves on lubricants (at different temperatures), useful insights have been obtained on how the viscosity shear rate curve of a lubricant should be ?designed? to give low friction (and hence improved fuel economy). A brief review is carried out of typical shear rates in key engine components, which is backed up by the authors? own calculations (using in-house lubrication software that includes realistic viscosity/temperature/shear rate data). It is found that shear rates in journal bearings are typically in the range of 105 to 5???106?s?1, whilst peak shear rates for the piston rings can be as high as 2???107?s?1, and for the valve train, peak shear rates can reach 2???108?s?1. Accurate viscosity shear rate curves have been measured for different temperatures using a range of viscometers, including a novel mid-shear capillary viscometer that is capable of measuring viscosities in the shear rate range of 104 to 106?s?1. The use of such a viscometer is crucial to obtain good fits to the measured data (since usually, viscosity data are only usually available at low shear rates, 102?103?s?1, and extremely high shear rates,?{\textgreater}?106?s?1, and such data are difficult to use for accurate viscosity/temperature/shear rate fits). The implications of the above data are then discussed for the design of low friction lubricants which give improved fuel economy. It is highlighted that the traditional high temperature high shear viscosity, HTHS150, measured at 150?? and a shear rate of 106?s?1, although adequate for bearing durability purposes, is probably not the ideal parameter to use for estimating the fuel economy potential of an oil (since shear rates in engines are usually much greater than 106?s?1, and also because oil temperatures in fuel economy engine tests are usually much lower than 150??). Other possible high shear viscosity parameters are discussed which may be an improvement on HTHS150. The work also highlights that the choice of viscosity modifier, and the amount used, can have a substantial impact on the fuel economy performance of a lubricant.},

The interfacial slip becomes severe with the increase of loading pressure and shear rate but it is insensitive to temperature. The shear stress increases with the loading pressure whereas the coefficient of friction shows a contrasting propensity. The shear stress and coefficient of friction increase with shear rate; and decrease with higher surface temperature. A logarithmic function has been proposed to correlate the variation of friction with shear rate. The shear viscosity increases exponentially with the loading pressure but this rheological component levels off when the loading pressure exceeds a critical value.},

In this study, we exploit non-equilibrium MD simulations to generate Couette flows with different combinations of thermostat algorithms and strategies. We provide a comprehensive analysis on the effectiveness of three thermostat algorithms Nosé-Hoover chain (NHC), Langevin (LGV) and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) when applied in three thermostat strategies, thermostating either walls (TW) or fluid (TF), and thermostating both the wall and fluid (TWTF). Our results of thermal and mechanical properties show that the TW strategy more closely resembles experimental conditions. The TF and TWTF systems also produce considerably similar behaviors in weakly sheared systems, but deviate the dynamics in strongly sheared systems due to the isothermal condition. The LGV and DPD thermostats used in the TF and TWTF systems provide vital ways to yield correct dynamics in coarse-grained systems by tuning the fluid transport coefficients. Using conventional NHC thermostat to thermostat fluid only produces correct thermal behaviors in weakly sheared systems, and breaks down due to significant thermal inhomogeneity in strongly sheared systems.},

@article{Liem1992,
abstract = {{The homogeneous-shear (HS{\}} technique has been used extensively to study shear How, but it uses artificial methods to remove the viscous heat generated. In reality the viscous heat is removed from the system by conduction out through the boundaries. This inevitably leads to characteristic gradients in temperature, density, and shear rate. While at low shear rates these effects may be neglected, and the use of HS justified, at high shear rates they certainly cannot, and doubts remain as to the validity of HS in this regime. In this study we make careful comparisons between HS and a more-realistic sliding-boundary method. HS gives very similar results when conditions corresponding to different regions within the sliding system are used. The use of HS simulations at shear rates where energy is generated at a rate faster than can be realistically removed by any natural process is called into question.

abstract = {This paper addresses an important materials engineering question: How can one identify the complete space (or as much of it as possible) of microstructures that are theoretically predicted to yield the desired combination of properties demanded by a selected application? We present a problem involving design of magnetoelastic Fe-Ga alloy microstructure for enhanced elastic, plastic and magnetostrictive properties. While theoretical models for computing properties given the microstructure are known for this alloy, inversion of these relationships to obtain microstructures that lead to desired properties is challenging, primarily due to the high dimensionality of microstructure space, multi-objective design requirement and non-uniqueness of solutions. These challenges render traditional search-based optimization methods incompetent in terms of both searching efficiency and result optimality. In this paper, a route to address these challenges using a machine learning methodology is proposed. A systematic framework consisting of random data generation, feature selection and classification algorithms is developed. Experiments with five design problems that involve identification of microstructures that satisfy both linear and nonlinear property constraints show that our framework outperforms traditional optimization methods with the average running time reduced by as much as 80{\%} and with optimality that would not be achieved otherwise.},

abstract = {In this work we show how different use of thermostating devices and modeling of walls influence the mechanical and dynamical properties of confined nanofluids. We consider a two dimensional fluid undergoing Couette flow using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Because the system is highly inhomogeneous, the density shows strong fluctuations across the channel. We compare the dynamics produced by applying a thermostating device directly to the fluid with that obtained when the wall is thermostated, considering also the effects of using rigid walls. This comparison involves an analysis of the chaoticity of the fluid and evaluation of mechanical properties across the channel. We look at two thermostating devices with either rigid or vibrating atomic walls and compare them with a system only thermostated by conduction through vibrating atomic walls. Sensitive changes are observed in the xy component of the pressure tensor, streaming velocity, and density across the pore and the Lyapunov localization of the fluid. We also find that the fluid slip can be significantly reduced by rigid walls. Our results suggest caution in interpreting the results of systems in which fluid atoms are thermostated and/or wall atoms are constrained to be rigid, such as, for example, water inside carbon nanotubes.},

abstract = {A multiscale simulation approach based on atomistic calculations and a discrete diffusion model is developed and applied to carbon-supersaturated ferrite, as experimentally observed in severely deformed pearlitic steel. We employ the embedded atom method and the nudged elastic band technique to determine the energetic profile of a carbon atom around a screw dislocation in bcc iron. The results clearly indicate a special region in the proximity of the dislocation core where C atoms are strongly bound, but where they can nevertheless diffuse easily due to low barriers. Our analysis suggests that the previously proposed pipe mechanism for the case of a screw dislocation is unlikely. Instead, our atomistic as well as the diffusion model results support the so-called drag mechanism, by which a mobile screw dislocation is able to transport C atoms along its glide plane. Combining the C-dislocation interaction energies with density-functional-theory calculations of the strain dependent C formation energy allows us to investigate the C supersaturation of the ferrite phase under wire drawing conditions. Corresponding results for local and total C concentrations agree well with previous atom probe tomography measurements indicating that a significant contribution to the supersaturation during wire drawing is due to dislocations.},

This wavelength m is found to be proportional to -1/2 and furthermore the wavelength is given by mKc-1/2=rc, where Kc is a constant, is the dislocation density and rc is defined as a dislocation- dislocation interaction distance.

abstract = {The inner structure of a material is called microstructure. It stores the genesis of a material and determines all its physical and chemical properties. While microstructural characterization is widely spread and well known, the microstructural classification is mostly done manually by human experts, which gives rise to uncertainties due to subjectivity. Since the microstructure could be a combination of different phases or constituents with complex substructures its automatic classification is very challenging and only a few prior studies exist. Prior works focused on designed and engineered features by experts and classified microstructures separately from the feature extraction step. Recently, Deep Learning methods have shown strong performance in vision applications by learning the features from data together with the classification step. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning method for microstructural classification in the examples of certain microstructural constituents of low carbon steel. This novel method employs pixel-wise segmentation via Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) accompanied by a max-voting scheme. Our system achieves 93.94{\%} classification accuracy, drastically outperforming the state-of-the-art method of 48.89{\%} accuracy. Beyond the strong performance of our method, this line of research offers a more robust and first of all objective way for the difficult task of steel quality appreciation.},

abstract = {Extraction and testing of miniature compression specimens from localized regions of components affected by rolling contact fatigue loading can provide significant insight into material degradation. Current ASTM standards for compression testing of cylindrical specimens become too stringent and difficult to achieve when specimen size is reduced to around 1 mm in diameter. The tolerances for surface flatness, parallelism of the loading surfaces, and the perpendicularity between the axis and the loading surfaces play crucial roles in the resulting stress-strain curves under uniaxial compression loading. In this manuscript, a systematic study is performed to quantify the influence of the above geometric parameters on the stress-strain response. Based on the analysis, the allowable geometric tolerances of miniature cylindrical specimens for a valid compression tests are recommended. The analysis results are validated and the usefulness of the method is demonstrated on miniature specimens extracted from the rolling contact fatigue affected regions of high strength M50 bearing balls. The yield stress within the rolling contact fatigue affected region is shown to increase by over 12{\%}.{\textcopyright} 2014 by ASME.},

abstract = {This paper systematically summarizes the cyclic deformation behaviors of different kinds of face-centered cubic (fcc) single crystals, including copper, nickel, silver, as well as copper-aluminium, copper-zinc alloys in attempt to provide a historical perspective of the developments over the last several decades. Combined with plenty of previous research results, the influencing factors on cyclic deformation behaviors can be listed as follows: orientations, stacking fault energy (SFE), short-range order (SRO) and friction stress, or more generally, the ease of cross slip. Among them, the effect of orientations mainly reflects in the formation of the complex dislocation patterns, which depends on the activating secondary slip system. According to the effect of slip mode, the materials can be divided into two types: pure metals and alloys. For pure fcc metals, the effect of SFE is decisive. Due to the easy cross slip of screw dislocations, regular dislocation arrangements, e.g. veins, persistent slip bands (PSBs), labyrinth and cell patterns, are always to form. With increase in alloying element, antiphase boundary energy gradually replaces SFE to become a new decisive factor affecting the cyclic deformation behaviors of fcc alloy single crystals. The corresponding dislocation arrangements consist of dipole array and stacking faults (SFs) under the influence of planar slip. The relationship among several factors is well explained, which will help us better understand the nature of the fatigue damage of metallic materials and then improve the performance of the related materials. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

HCFO-1233zd(E) has a very short atmospheric lifetime of 26 days and a global warming potential (GWP) of less than 5 (Wong et al., http://www.honeywell-solsticelba.com.product-info/environmental-regulatory/{\#}atmospheric-impact, 2012). This makes it an excellent environmentally friendly candidate for many applications including refrigeration, foam expansion agents, and as solvents. In this work we have presented our measurements of physical properties like the boiling point, critical temperature, vapor pressure, liquid density, and surface tension of HCFO-1233zd(E). We have also provided our calculated ideal gas heat capacity at constant pressure using quantum mechanical theory. Temperature-dependent properties are correlated with standard forms of equations and described in the paper.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. The adsorption phenomenon of refrigerant R-1233zd(E) molecules on a hematite Fe 2 O 3 (0112) surface is studied at the quantum level thanks to density functional theory + U (DFT + U) calculations employing a van der Waals functional combined with a spin-polarized system. The results show different adsorption sites on the solid surface depending on orientations of the molecule, characterizing strong interactions between the refrigerant molecule and both iron and oxygen atoms. A range of binding energy values of -0.92 to -0.22 eV is observed. These ab initio results are used to parametrize a force field at the refrigerant-hematite interface for larger scale molecular dynamics simulations. Effects of these ab initio considerations on density and velocity profiles are studied, in the case of a confined fluid between two surfaces as in a lubricated contact. The high binding energy values induce a locking effect of the R-1233zd(E) molecules close to the hematite surface, showing a resistance to compression (P z = 500 MPa) and shearing (v s = 20 m/s).},

abstract = {Fracture toughness testing of materials at the micrometer scale has become essential due to the continuing miniaturization of devices accompanied by findings of size effects in fracture behavior. Many techniques have emerged in the recent past to carry out fracture toughness measurements at the relevant micro and nanolength scales, but they lack ASTM standards that are prescribed for bulk scale tests. Also, differences in reported values arise at the microscale due to the sample preparation technique, test method, geometry, and investigator. To correct for such discrepancies, we chose four different fracture toughness test geometries in practice, all of them micromachined in the focused ion beam (FIB), to investigate the fracture toughness of Si(100) at the micrometer scale. The average K IC that emerges from all four cases is a constant (0.8 MPa m1/2). The advantages and limitations of each of these geometries in terms of test parameters and the range of materials that can be tested are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper systematically summarizes the cyclic deformation behaviors of different kinds of face-centered cubic (fcc) single crystals, including copper, nickel, silver, as well as copper-aluminium, copper-zinc alloys in attempt to provide a historical perspective of the developments over the last several decades. Combined with plenty of previous research results, the influencing factors on cyclic deformation behaviors can be listed as follows: orientations, stacking fault energy (SFE), short-range order (SRO) and friction stress, or more generally, the ease of cross slip. Among them, the effect of orientations mainly reflects in the formation of the complex dislocation patterns, which depends on the activating secondary slip system. According to the effect of slip mode, the materials can be divided into two types: pure metals and alloys. For pure fcc metals, the effect of SFE is decisive. Due to the easy cross slip of screw dislocations, regular dislocation arrangements, e.g. veins, persistent slip bands (PSBs), labyrinth and cell patterns, are always to form. With increase in alloying element, antiphase boundary energy gradually replaces SFE to become a new decisive factor affecting the cyclic deformation behaviors of fcc alloy single crystals. The corresponding dislocation arrangements consist of dipole array and stacking faults (SFs) under the influence of planar slip. The relationship among several factors is well explained, which will help us better understand the nature of the fatigue damage of metallic materials and then improve the performance of the related materials. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The n-decane chains were modeled using an anisotropic version of the united-atom model with fixed bond lengths. The results of our simulations verify the equivalence between the steady state time averages of the atomic and molecular stress tensors. In the range of shear rates which have been investigated, our results show that the values of the viscosity coefficient depend mainly on the shape of the intermolecular potential and they are insensitive to the shape of the torsion potential. Moreover, the viscosity coefficient as a function of the shear rate shows a region of shear thinning at low shear rates followed by a region of shear thickening. The study of the alignment induced in the fluid by the perturbing field shows that after a region of fast increasing of the degree of alignment with increasing shear rate, this reaches a maximum and slowly begins to decrease. This behavior can be related to the fact that at high shear rates the chains tend to adopt a more shrunken mean shape.},

abstract = {Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we study the non-Newtonian rheological behaviors of a monoatomic fluid governed by the Lennard-Jones potential. Both steady Couette and oscillatory shear flows are investigated. Shear thinning and normal stress effects are observed in the steady Couette flow simulations. The radial distribution function is calculated at different shear rates to exhibit the change of the microscopic structure of molecules due to shear. We observe that for a larger shear rate the repulsion between molecules is more powerful while the attraction is weaker, and the above phenomena can also be confirmed by the analyses of the potential energy. By applying an oscillatory shear to the system, several findings are worth mentioning here: First, the phase difference between the shear stress and shear rate increases with the frequency. Second, the real part of complex viscosity first increases and then decreases while the imaginary part tends to increase monotonically, which results in the increase of the proportion of the imaginary part to the real part with the increasing frequency. Third, the ratio of the elastic modulus to the viscous modulus also increases with the frequency. These phenomena all indicate the appearance of viscoelasticity and the domination of, elasticity over viscosity at high oscillation frequency for Lennard-Jones fluids.},

abstract = {Rolling contact fatigue in bearing steels is manifested by dark-etching regions, which are attributed to deformation induced tempering. In order to quantitatively explain this phenomenon, a model is suggested for martensite tempering assisted by dislocation glide during rolling contact fatigue. In the model, dislocations transport carbon from the matrix to carbide particles, provided that the carbon is located at a certain distance range from the dislocation contributing to the tempering process. By calculating the amount of carbon in the matrix, the kinetics of carbide thickening and hardness reduction are computed. It is found that the dark-etching region kinetics can be controlled by both bearing operation conditions (temperature and deformation rate) and microstructure (type, size, and volume fraction of carbides). The model is validated against tested bearings, and its limitations are discussed.},

The proposed model yields predictions of WEAs appearance, agreeing with experimental observations. Bearing life can be estimated by the WEA appearance model. The three microstructural alterations models are combined and, for the first time, it becomes possible to predict the occurrence and the formation progress of WEAs, DERs and WEBs with a unified theory.

abstract = {Structural changes produced in various materials by rolling contact fatigue under various conditions are classified into 4 types (dark tint, dark needle, dark line and white band), depending upon test temperature, tempering resistance of the material, contact stress and loading cycle. Structural changes named dark tint, dark needle and dark line are observed in this order at different stages of the loading cycle in some cases. Compressive residual stress is produced by shear stress $\tau$45 at the initial stage of rolling contact fatigue. When the contact stress is greater than Pmax = 600 kg/mm2, the stress peak saturates and the saturation value is smaller as the hardness of the specimen is lower. A rise in microhardness occurs after 106 cycles and is considered to be work hardening produced by $\tau$0 Once the dark line type of structural change appears as the loading cycle increases, the hardness decreases locally. Although the changed structure is essentially soft, these structural changes make the rolling fatigue life longer. Various kinds of structural change obtained by different investigators are thought to be due to the variety of test conditions, especially the temperature rise of the specimen which is influenced not only by the contact stress but also by the rotational speed and contact area. {\textcopyright} 1970.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.A novel methodology, based on the use of phosphorescence imaging, is applied to determine the local through-thickness velocity profile of lubricant in an elastohydrodynamic contact. The technique has spatial and temporal resolutions of 40 $\mu$m and 340 $\mu$s respectively and thus allows lubricant rheology to be investigated at conditions close to service conditions. The capability of the newly-developed method is verified by examining the flow of 5P4E polyphenyl ether, a lubricant base fluid used in very high temperature applications and is well-known for its high viscosity-pressure coefficient. Experimental results highlight the effect of the contact pressure on the velocity profile of this fluid in lubricated contacts. At low pressures, the velocity profile of 5P4E is close to linear, characteristic of Couette flow. As the local pressure increases, its velocity profile progressively deviates from a Couette profile and shear banding is evident at high pressure.},

abstract = {The EHD friction properties of a wide range of base fluids have been measured and compared in mixed sliding–rolling conditions at three temperatures and two pressures. The use of tungsten carbide ball and disc specimens enabled high mean contact pressures of 1.5 and 2.0 GPa to be obtained, comparable to those present in many rolling bearings. The measurements confirm the importance of molecular structure of the base fluid in determining EHD friction. Liquids having linear-shaped molecules with flexible bonds give considerably lower friction than liquids based on molecules with bulky side groups or rings. EHD friction also increases with viscosity for liquids having similar molecular structures. Using pure ester fluids, it is shown that quite small differences in molecular structure can have considerable effects on EHD friction. The importance of temperature rise in reducing EHD friction at slide–roll ratios above about 5{\%} has been shown. By measuring EHD friction at several temperatures and pressures as well as EHD film thickness, approximate corrections to measured EHD friction data have been made to obtain isothermal shear stress and thus EHD friction curves. These show that under the conditions tested most low molecular weight base fluids do not reach a limiting friction coefficient and thus shear stress. However, two high traction base fluids appear to reach limiting values, while three linear polymeric base fluids may also do so. Constants of best fit to a linear/logarithmic isothermal shear stress/strain rate relationship have been provided to enable reconstruction of isothermal EHD friction behaviour for most of the fluids tested.},

abstract = {For steel contacts it is usual for the longer molecular chain lengths of saturated linear hydrocarbons and their acids and alcohols to reduce the coefficient of friction in the boundary-lubrication regime. However, the effect of these lubricant properties on DLC contacts is still unknown. Since the boundary-lubrication mechanisms between DLC coatings and conventional additives do not appear to be as effective as with metals, other potential mechanisms, even though based on weaker interactions or the oils physical and rheological properties, may thus be very relevant. In this study we focus on the influence of the base oils chain length and viscosity on the friction and wear in DLC/DLC contacts, and we compare this behaviour with conventional steel/steel contacts, using several simple linear hydrocarbons, i.e., alkanes, and complex branched hydrocarbons, i.e., polyalphaolefins. The results show that in both the steel/steel and DLC/DLC contacts the wear decreases with a longer molecular chain length and a higher viscosity of the oil. However, in DLC/DLC contacts the coefficient of friction increases when oil with a longer molecular chain length or a higher viscosity is used, and decreases with the lower oil viscosity and shorter chain lengths, which is just the opposite to conventional steel/steel behaviour. These results are analysed and discussed in view of lubricant cohesive energy, surface tension, shear strength, viscosity and chain length. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

To get an insight into the effects of molecular architecture in the behaviour of these thin lubricant films we have studied six different molecules, mainly isomers of C30. In this work the effect of branching on rheological properties and behaviour of lubricant film is examined. Our study shows viscosity and normal stress effects depend on the degree of branching. Dynamics of the molecules and their orientation are also affected by the degree of branching. A weaker layering near the wall is observed for branched molecules. Slip between the wall and lubricant film also was larger for branched molecules. Branched molecules had less tendency to change their orientation under the flow. The results obtained here could be helpful in designing new lubricants at the molecular level. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to study the effect of molecular chain length on frictional behavior of confined thin liquid films under shear. One of the walls confining the films, composed of linear alkanes (chain length 6-80), was moved at a constant velocity for two different pressures. The results indicate that there are distinct differences in frictional behavior under fast sliding velocity between low and high pressures. Under high pressure, interfacial slip appears between the moving wall, base, and the film, and shear stress doe not depend on the chain length. On the other hand, for low pressure, interlayer slips within the film appear in longer chains and shear stress depends on the chain length. In the interfacial and interlayer slip regions, more heat generated by friction is observed. Also, the interfacial shear stress is caused by the slider, interlayer shear stress is caused by interwined and locked layers, and both these stresses have maximum values. When the maximum interfacial shear stress is larger than the maximum interlayer shear stress, interlayer slips occur and in the reverse, interfacial slip occurs. When both maximum shear stresses are larger than the required shear stress for the film to have a uniform shear rate, there is no slip.},

abstract = {A number of major studies have demonstrated that the SVOC (Semi-volatile organic compounds) within engine emissions derive predominantly from unburned fuel and lubricants, and are a major contributor to primary atmospheric aerosol containing thousands of organic compounds. The GC × GC-ToF-MS (2 dimensional Gas Chromatography – Time of Flight – Mass Spectrometry) comprehensive analytical technique was utilized in this study, to resolve the complex mixtures and characterize the SVOC content in eight different commercial lubricants, including 5 W30 synthetic and semi-synthetic, mineral and base oil. In order to quantify the aliphatic isomers, which comprise the largest component of the lubricants, a TIC-M.Q./Mass (Total ion current ratio to the molar quantity/mass) method has been developed. The TIC intensity was observed to be proportional to the molar quantity of n-alkanes for carbon number {\textless}C25, while being linear to the mass response for these aliphatic compounds with carbon number {\textgreater}C25. Additionally, the TIC intensity of the alkyl-cyclohexanes under the identical retention indices were found to have an equivalent response to those of the n-alkanes, showing that the quantitative calibrations derived for the n-alkane series could be applied to estimate the concentrations of isomeric aliphatic compounds with similar molecular weight. Furthermore, a mesh method was introduced to group the alkane species (n-alkanes, branched alkanes and cyclic alkanes etc.), combining with the use of a soft EI (electron impact) ionization (14 eV) to retain the distinct identity of the isomers with less fragmentation, which allowed the TIC-M.Q./Mass methodology to integrate all the constitutional isomers present in the lubricating oil samples. By utilizing this methodology, compositions from different samples were comprehensively compared, leading to the following conclusions: 1) the synthetic and semi-synthetic oils contained a larger abundance of HMW (high molecular weight) aliphatic compounds (carbon number C24–C29), while those in the LMW (low molecular weight range, carbon number C18–C25) were predominant in the mineral and base oil; 2) cycloalkanes were predominant in the synthetic and semi-synthetic oils; whereas the branched alkanes were more prominent in the mineral and base oils; 3) for lubricants used for a short period, a slight increase of LMW compounds was observed, while the HMW compounds underwent a decrease, whereas, there was an overall mass reduction for all the aliphatic compounds detected in the oil samples used for six-months.},

abstract = {This work integrates in-situ neutron diffraction and crystal plasticity finite element modeling to study the kinematic stability of retained austenite in high carbon bearing steels. The presence of a kinematically metastable retained austenite in bearing steels can significantly affect the macro-mechanical and micro-mechanical material response. Mechanical characterization of metastable austenite is a critical component in accurately capturing the micro-mechanical behavior under typical application loads. Traditional mechanical characterization techniques are unable to discretely quantify the micro-mechanical response of the austenite, and as a result, the computational predictions rely heavily on trial and error or qualitative descriptions of the austenite phase. In order to overcome this, in the present work, we use in-situ neutron diffraction of a uniaxial tension test of an A485 Grade 1 bearing steel specimen. The mechanical response determined from the neutron diffraction analysis was incorporated into a hybrid crystal plasticity finite element model that accounts for the martensite's crystal plasticity and the stress-assisted transformation from austenite to martensite in bearing steels. The modeling response was used to estimate the single crystal elastic constants of the austenite and martensite phases. The results show that using in-situ neutron diffraction, coupled with a crystal plasticity model, can successfully predict both the micro-mechanical and macro-mechanical responses of bearing steels while accounting for the martensitic transformation of the retained austenite.},

abstract = {In this study the rolling contact fatigue (RCF) of case carburized AISI 8620 steel was numerically and experimentally investigated. For the numerical study, a two dimensional finite element (FE) RCF model based on the continuum damage mechanics (CDM) was developed to investigate the fatigue damage accumulation, crack propagation and final fatigue life of carburized AISI 8620 steel under various operating conditions. A randomly generated Voronoi tessellation was used to model the effects of material microstructure topology. The boundaries of the Voronoi elements were assumed to be the weak planes where damage accumulates, cracks initiate and propagate to simulate inter-granular cracks. A series of torsional fatigue tests were conducted on carburized AISI 8620 steel specimens containing 0{\%} and 35{\%} retained austenite (RA) to determine fatigue load (S) vs. life (N) of the material. The S-N results were then used to determine the material parameters necessary for the rolling contact fatigue model. The torsional fatigue test results indicate that the carburized AISI 8620 specimens with higher RA demonstrate higher life than the specimens with lower RA. The RCF model also indicates that the material with higher level of compressive residual stresses (RS) and retained austenite demonstrates higher RCF life. In order to corroborate the results of RCF model, a three-ball-on-rod rolling contact fatigue test rig was used to determine the RCF lives of carburized AISI 8620 steels with different amounts of RA. The fatigue life and cracks evolution pattern from the numerical and experimental results were corroborated. The results indicate that they are in good agreement.},

abstract = {In rolling contact bearings, contact occurs between the rolling surfaces over a small region. Hence, high contact stresses are induced in the region even under a small load. These stresses are cyclic in nature. Over a long period of time, the surface gets fatigued and surface fatigue wear ensues. The experimental investigation carried out in the laboratory earlier consumed a long time. Therefore, a numerical approach is resorted to in this paper. To study this aspect, the stress field in the contact surface region is analyzed under elastohydrodynamic lubrication with line contact considering the friction effect. The bearing steel microstructure is considered as a mixture of martensite and retained austenite having entirely different mechanical properties and yield behavior. Using finite element analysis, the stress field has been evaluated taking into account two volumetric fractions (8{\%} and 20{\%}) of retained austenite in heat treated AISI 52100 bearing steel. A simplified approach neglecting the effect of strain induced transformation of austenite is attempted in the first phase. The depth at which the failure is expected to occur is compared with the experimental values of earlier investigation. The predicted values are marginally higher than the experimental values.},

abstract = {Fatigue life of heavily loaded rolling bearings is strongly dependent on elastic-plastic material properties. For bearing steels these elastic-plastic properties can be accurately obtained by performing monotonic or half-compressive tests. A three-dimensional strain deformation analysis based on the incremental theory of plasticity and the use of Prandtl-Reuss relations in conjunction with the von Mises yield criterion was developed in order to evaluate the permanent deformation in dry contacts loaded above the elastic limit in case of normal loading. The Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain relation for two martensitically hardened variants of SAE 52100 bearing steel considered the nonlinear kinematic and/or isotropic material behavior. Parameters describing the influence of retained austenite are modeled by using a nonlinear isotropic law. Pressure distribution and contact surface displacements during incremental loading are evaluated by using a conjugate gradient method and the internal stress field is derived by using the superposition principle. Further, a fast analysis of smooth surfaces in elastic-plastic static and rolling contact is developed based on analytical relations for the internal stress field. Cyclic evaluation of plastic strains and residual stresses is carried out until shakedown. In order to verify the theoretical model, rolling contact tests under high normal load were performed. Residual stresses and residual profiles measurements show excellent agreement between numerical and measured cyclic values.},

@article{Raabe2012,
abstract = {Different fluoropropenes are currently considered as refrigerants, either as pure compounds or as components in low GWP (global warming potential) refrigerant mixtures. Due to their limited commercial production, experimental data for the thermophysical properties of fluoropropenes and their mixtures are in general rare, which hampers the exploration of their performance in technical applications. In principle, molecular simulation can be used to predict the relevant properties of refrigerants and refrigerant blends, provided that adequate intermolecular potential functions ("force fields") are available. In our earlier work (Raabe, G.; Maginn, E. J., J. Phys. Chem. B2010, 114, 10133-10142), we introduced a transferable force field for fluoropropenes comprising the compounds 3,3,3-trifluoro-1-propene (HFO-1243zf), 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene (HFO-1234yf), and hexafluoro-1-propene (HFO-1216). In this paper, we provide an extension of the force field model to the trans- and cis-1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene (HFO-1234ze(E), HFO-1234ze) and the cis-1,2,3,3,3-pentafluoro-1-propene (HFO-1225ye(Z)) as well as revised simulation results for HFO-1216. We present Gibbs ensemble simulation results on the vapor pressures, saturated densities, and heats of vaporization of these compounds in comparison with experimental results. The simulation results show that the force field model enables reliable predictions of the properties of the different fluoropropenes and also reproduces well the differing vapor-liquid coexistence and vapor pressure curve of the cis- and trans-isomers of 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-1-propene, HFO-1234ze and HFO-1234ze(E). For these two isomers, we also present molecular dynamics simulation studies on their local structure.},

abstract = {Sub-stoichiometric interstitial compounds, including binary transition metal carbides (MC(1−x)), maintain structural stability even if they accommodate abundant anion vacancies. This unique character endows them with variable-composition, diverse-configuration and controllable-performance through composition and structure design. Herein, the evolution of carbon vacancy (V(C)) configuration in sub-stoichiometric ZrC(1−x) is investigated by combining the cluster expansion method and first-principles calculations. We report the interesting self-assembly of V(C)s and the fingerprint V(C) configuration (V(C) triplet constructed by 3(rd) nearest neighboring vacancies) in all the low energy structures of ZrC(1−x). When V(C) concentration is higher than the critical value of 0.5 (x {\textgreater} 0.5), the 2(nd) nearest neighboring V(C) configurations with strongly repulsive interaction inevitably appear, and meanwhile, the system energy (or formation enthalpy) of ZrC(1−x) increases sharply which suggests the material may lose phase stability. The present results clarify why ZrC(1−x) bears a huge amount of V(C)s, tends towards V(C) ordering, and retains stability up to a stoichiometry of x = 0.5.},

abstract = {Changes in microstructure and mechanical properties of nuclear materials are governed by the kinetics of defects produced by irradiation. The population of vacancies, interstitials and their clusters can however be followed only indirectly, for example by macroscopic resistivity measurements. The information on the mobility, recombination, clustering or dissociation of defects provided by such experiments is both extremely rich and difficult to interpret. By combining ab initio and kinetic Monte Carlo methods, we successfully reproduce the abrupt resistivity changes-so-called recovery stages-observed upon annealing at increasing temperatures after electron irradiation in alpha-iron. New features in the mechanisms responsible for these stages are revealed. We show that di-vacancies and tri-interstitials contribute to the stages attributed to mono-vacancy and di-interstitial migration respectively. We also predict the effect of the unexpected low migration barriers found for tri- and quadri-vacancies, and discuss the challenging questions raised by the mobility of larger defect clusters.},

abstract = {The problem of white etching band (WEB) formation in races of rolling bearings experiencing rolling contact fatigue is addressed in this paper. Neither the remarkable directionality of WEBs, nor the observed rate of their growth has been satisfactorily explained up to date. The previous attempts to explain the observed WEB orientation are critically reviewed. A new physical concept of WEB formation is introduced. It is suggested that diffusional outflow of dissolved carbon from WEBs, primarily caused by cyclic stress induced release of carbon segregated in the form of dislocation atmospheres, plays a fundamental role in WEB formation. Based on this concept, a dramatic improvement in the prediction of WEB formation rate is achieved (as compared to the previous analyses). The suggested physical concept leads to a new criterion of WEB orientation, involving maximization of the amplitude of variation of the deviatoric normal stress acting across the WEB, and taking into consideration the sequence of alternating stress extrema in a contact stress cycle. Peculiarities of the second of the two experimentally observed families of WEBs are discussed, and the new criterion is modified accordingly. The new WEB orientation criterion provides for the first time a consistent explanation of all basic features of the observed WEB directionality. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},
